    "Appendix Key A more complete discussion of the items presented below can be found by accessing the supporting documents at the designated hyperlinks. Appropriateness Category : The panel's recommendation for a procedure based on the assessment of the risks and benefits of performing the procedure for the specified clinical scenario. SOE : Strength of Evidence. The assessment of the amount and quality of evidence found in the peer reviewed medical literature for an appropriateness recommendation. References: The citation number and PMID for the reference(s) associated with the recommendation. • Study Quality : The assessment of the quality of an individual reference based on the number of study quality elements described in the reference. • RRL : Relative Radiation Level. A population based assessment of the amount of radiation a typical patient may be exposed to during the specified procedure. Rating : The final rating (1-9 scale) for the procedure as determined by the panel during rating rounds. Median : The median rating (1-9 scale) for the procedure as determined by the panel during rating rounds. Final tabulations: A histogram showing the number of panel members who rated the procedure as noted in the column heading (ie, 1, 2, 3, etc.).
