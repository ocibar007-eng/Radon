    "Preface In this eighth edition of TNM Classification of Malignant Tumours , many of the tumour sites are unchanged from the seventh edition 1 . However, some tumour entities and anatomic sites have been newly introduced and some tumours contain modifications: this follows the basic philosophy of maintaining stability of the classification over time. The modifications and additions reflect new data on prognosis as well as new methods for assessing prognosis. 2 Some changes had already appeared in the TNM Supplement 3 as proposals. Subsequent support warrants their incorporation into the classification. New proposals for tumours of parathyroid carcinoma, and paraganglionoma will be published in the next edition of the TNM Supplement . In the seventh edition a new approach was adopted to separate stage groupings from prognostic groupings in which other prognostic factors are added to T, N, and M categories. These new prognostic groupings were presented for oesophagus and prostate. In this eighth edition, the term ‘stage’ is used when only descriptions of anatomic extent of disease are used and ‘prognostic group’ for when additional prognostic factors are incorporated. Changes made between the seventh and eighth editions are indicated by a bar at the left hand side of the text. To avoid ambiguity, users are encouraged to cite the edition and year of the TNM publication they have used in their list of references. A TNM homepage with Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) and a form for submitting questions or comments on the TNM can be found at: http://www.uicc.org. The UICC’s TNM Prognostic Factors Project has a process for evaluating proposals to change the TNM Classification. This procedure aims at a continuous systematic approach composed of two arms: (1) review formal proposals from investigators and (2) an annual literature search for articles concerning improvements to TNM. The proposals and results of the literature search are evaluated by a UICC panel of experts as well as by the TNM Prognostic Factors committee members. 5 The national TNM Committees participated in this process.

    "Introduction The History of the TNM System* The TNM system for the classification of malignant tumours was developed by Pierre Denoix (France) between the years 1943 and 1952. 1 In 1950, the UICC appointed a Committee on Tumour Nomenclature and Statistics. As a basis for its work on clinical stage classification, it adopted the general definitions of local extension of malignant tumours suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO) Sub Committee on The Registration of Cases of Cancer as well as Their Statistical Presentation. 2 In 1958, the Committee published the first recommendations for the clinical stage classification of cancers of the breast and larynx and for the presentation of results. 3 A second publication in 1959 presented revised proposals for the breast, for clinical use and evaluation over a 5 year period (1960–1964). 4 In 1968, a booklet, the Livre de Poche 5 and, a year later, a complementary booklet was published detailing recommendations for the setting up of field trials, for the presentation of end results, and for the determination and expression of cancer survival rates. 6 The Livre de Poche was subsequently translated into 11 languages. In 1974 and 1978, second and third editions 7,8 were published containing new site classifications, and the fourth edition of TNM in 1987. 9 In 1993, the project published the TNM Supplement 10 to promote the uniform use of TNM by providing detailed explanations of the TNM rules with practical examples. Second, third, and fourth editions appeared in 2001, 2003, and 2012. 11–13 The project also publishes the TNM Atlas an Illustrated Guide to the TNM Classification of Malignant Tumours , the sixth edition was published in 2014 as a companion to the seventh edition of the TNM Classification . 14 In 1995, the project published Prognostic Factors in Cancer, 15 a compilation and discussion of prognostic factors in cancer, both anatomical and non anatomical, at each of the body sites. This was expanded in the second edition in 2001 16 and the third edition in 2006. 17 The current eighth edition of TNM contains rules of classification and staging that correspond with those appearing in the eighth edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual (2017). 18 While the aim of the UICC and AJCC is to have identical classifications, small differences exist and are identified as footnotes to the text. Wherever possible, the UICC classification is based on published evidence based recommendation. To develop and sustain a classification system acceptable to all requires the closest liaison",
    "between national and international organizations. As noted, while the classification is based on published evidence, in areas where high level evidence is not available it is based on international consensus. The continuing objective of the UICC is to present the classification of anatomical extent of cancer globally. Note * A more detailed history is available on the website at www.uicc.org The Principles of the TNM System The practice of classifying cancer cases into groups according to anatomical extent, termed ‘stage’, arose from the observation that survival rates were higher for cases in which the disease was localized than for those in which the disease had extended beyond the organ of origin. The stage of disease at the time of diagnosis is a reflection not only of the rate of growth and extension of the neoplasm but also the type of tumour and the tumour–host relationship. It is important to record accurate information on the anatomical extent of the disease for each site at the time of diagnosis, to meet the following objectives: 1. to aid the clinician in the planning of treatment 2. to give some indication of prognosis for survival 3. to assist in evaluation of the results of treatment 4. to facilitate the exchange of information between treatment centres 5. to contribute to the continuing investigation of human cancer 6. to support cancer control activities. Cancer staging is essential to patient care, research, and cancer control. Cancer control activities include direct patient care related activities, the development and implementation of clinical practice guidelines, and centralized activities such as recording disease extent in cancer registries for surveillance purposes and planning cancer systems. Recording of stage is essential for the evaluation of outcomes of clinical practice and cancer programmes. However, in order to evaluate the long term outcomes of populations, it is important for the classification to remain stable. There is therefore a conflict between a classification that is updated to include the most current forms of medical knowledge while also maintaining a classification that facilitating longitudinal studies. The UICC TNM Project aims to address both needs. International agreement on the classification of cancer by extent of disease provides a method of conveying disease extent to others without ambiguity. There are many axes of tumour classification: for example, the anatomical site and the clinical and pathological extent of disease, the duration of symptoms or signs, the gender and age of the patient, and the histological type and grade of the tumour. All of these have",
    "an influence on the outcome of the disease. Classification by anatomical extent of disease is the one with which the TNM system primarily deals. The clinician's immediate task when meeting a patient with a new diagnosis of cancer is to make a judgment as to prognosis and a decision as to the most effective course of treatment. This judgment and this decision require, among other things, an objective assessment of the anatomical extent of the disease. To meet the stated objectives a system of classification is needed: 1. that is applicable to all sites regardless of treatment; and 2. that may be supplemented later by further information that becomes available from histopathology and/or surgery. The TNM system meets these requirements. The General Rules of the TNM System a,b The TNM system for describing the anatomical extent of disease is based on the assessment of three components: T– the extent of the primary tumour N– the absence or presence and extent of regional lymph node metastasis M– the absence or presence of distant metastasis. The addition of numbers to these three components indicates the extent of the malignant disease, thus: T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, N0, N1, N2, N3, M0, M1 In effect, the system is a ‘shorthand notation’ for describing the extent of a particular malignant tumour. The general rules applicable to all sites are as follows: 1. All cases should be confirmed microscopically. Any cases not so proved must be reported separately. 2. Two classifications are described for each site, namely: a. Clinical classification: the pretreatment clinical classification) designated TNM (or cTNM) is essential to select and evaluate therapy. This is based on evidence acquired before treatment. Such evidence is gathered from physical examination, imaging, endoscopy, biopsy, surgical exploration, and other relevant examinations. b. Pathological classification: the postsurgical histopathological classification, designated pTNM , is used to guide adjuvant therapy and provides additional data to estimate prognosis and end results. This is based on evidence acquired before treatment, supplemented or modified by additional evidence acquired from surgery and from pathological examination. The pathological assessment of the primary",
    "tumour (pT) entails a resection of the primary tumour or biopsy adequate to evaluate the highest pT category. The pathological assessment of the regional lymph nodes (pN) entails removal of the lymph nodes adequate to validate the absence of regional lymph node metastasis (pN0) or sufficient to evaluate the highest pN category. An excisional biopsy of a lymph node without pathological assessment of the primary is insufficient to fully evaluate the pN category and is a clinical classification. The pathological assessment of distant metastasis (pM) entails microscopic examination of metastatic deposit. 3. After assigning T, N, and M and/or pT, pN, and pM categories, these may be grouped into stages. The TNM classification and stages, are established at diagnosis and must remain unchanged in the medical records. Only for cancer surveillance purposes, clinical and pathological data may be combined when only partial information is available either in the pathological classification or the clinical classification. 4. If there is doubt concerning the correct T, N, or M category to which a particular case should be allotted, then the lower (i.e., less advanced) category should be chosen. This will also be reflected in the stage. 5. In the case of multiple primary tumours in one organ, the tumour with the highest T category should be classified and the multiplicity or the number of tumours should be indicated in parenthesis, e.g., T2(m) or T2(5). In simultaneous bilateral primary cancers of paired organs, each tumour should be classified independently. In tumours of the liver, ovary and fallopian tube, multiplicity is a criterion of T classification, and in tumours of the lung multiplicity may be a criterion of the M classification. 6. Definitions of the TNM categories and stage may be telescoped or expanded for clinical or research purposes as long as the basic definitions recommended are not changed. For instance, any T, N, or M can be divided into subgroups. Notes a For more details on classification the reader is referred to the TNM Supplement. b An educational module is available on the UICC website www.uicc.org. Anatomical Regions and Sites The sites in this classification are listed by code number of the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology. 19 Each region or site is described under the following headings: Rules for classification with the procedures for assessing the T, N, and M categories Anatomical sites, and subsites if appropriate Definition of the regional lymph nodes",

Tumour deposits (satellites), i.e., macro or microscopic nests or nodules, in the lymph drainage area of a primary carcinoma without histological evidence of residual lymph node in the nodule, may represent discontinuous spread, venous invasion (V1/2) or a totally replaced lymph node. If a nodule is considered by the pathologist to be a totally replaced lymph node (generally having a smooth contour), it should be recorded as a positive lymph node, and each such nodule should be counted separately as a lymph node in the final pN determination. Metastasis in any lymph node other than regional is classified as a distant metastasis. When size is a criterion for pN classification, measurement is made of the metastasis,",
    "not of the entire lymph node. The measurement should be that of the largest dimension of the tumour. Cases with micrometastasis only, i.e., no metastasis larger than 0.2 cm, can be identified by the addition of ‘(mi)’, e.g., pN1(mi). Sentinel Lymph Node The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from a primary tumour. If it contains metastatic tumour this indicates that other lymph nodes may contain tumour. If it does not contain metastatic tumour, other lymph nodes are not likely to contain tumour. Occasionally, there is more than one sentinel lymph node. The following designations are applicable when sentinel lymph node assessment is attempted: (p)NX(sn) Sentinel lymph node could not be assessed (p)N0(sn) No sentinel lymph node metastasis (p)N1(sn) Sentinel lymph node metastasis Isolated Tumour Cells Isolated tumour cells (ITC) are single tumour cells or small clusters of cells not more than 0.2 mm in greatest extent that can be detected by routine H and E stains or immunohistochemistry. An additional criterion has been proposed in breast cancer to include a cluster of fewer than 200 cells in a single histological cross section. Others have proposed for other tumour sites that a cluster should have 20 cells or fewer; definitions of ITC may vary by tumour site. ITCs do not typically show evidence of metastatic activity (e.g., proliferation or stromal reaction) or penetration of vascular or lymphatic sinus walls. Cases with ITC in lymph nodes or at distant sites should be classified as N0 or M0, respectively. The same applies to cases with findings suggestive of tumour cells or their components by non morphological techniques such as flow cytometry or DNA analysis. The exceptions are in malignant melanoma of the skin and Merkel cell carcinoma, wherein ITC in a lymph node are classified as N1. These cases should be analysed separately. 20 Their classification is as follows. (p)N0 No regional lymph node metastasis histologically, no examination for isolated tumour cells (ITC) (p)N0(i–) No regional lymph node metastasis histologically, negative morphological findings for ITC (p)N0(i+) No regional lymph node metastasis histologically, positive morphological findings for ITC (p)N0(mol–) No regional lymph node metastasis histologically, negative non morphological findings for ITC",
    "(p)N0(mol+) No regional lymph node metastasis histologically, positive non morphological findings for ITC Cases with or examined for isolated tumour cells (ITC) in sentinel lymph nodes can be classified as follows: (p)N0(i–) (sn) No sentinel lymph node metastasis histologically, negative morphological findings for ITC (p)N0(i+) (sn) No sentinel lymph node metastasis histologically, positive morphological findings for ITC (p)N0(mol–) (sn) No sentinel lymph node metastasis histologically, negative non morphological findings for ITC (p)N0 (mol+) (sn) No sentinel lymph node metastasis histologically, positive non morphological findings for ITC pM – Distant Metastasis * pM1 Distant metastasis microscopically confirmed Note * pM0 and pMX are not valid categories. The category pM1 may be further specified in the same way as M1 (see page 6). Isolated tumour cells found in bone marrow with morphological techniques are classified according to the scheme for N, e.g., M0(i+). For non morphological findings ‘mol’ is used in addition to M0, e.g., M0 (mol+). Histopathological Grading In most sites, further information regarding the primary tumour may be recorded under the following heading: G – Histopathological Grading GX Grade of differentiation cannot be assessed G1 Well differentiated G2 Moderately differentiated G3 Poorly differentiated G4 Undifferentiated Notes Grades 3 and 4 can be combined in some circumstances as ‘G3 4, poorly differentiated",
    "or undifferentiated’. Special systems of grading are recommended for tumours of breast, corpus uteri, and prostate. Additional Descriptors For identification of special cases in the TNM or pTNM classification, the m, y, r, and a symbols may be used. Although they do not affect the stage grouping, they indicate cases needing separate analysis. m Symbol. The suffix m, in parentheses, is used to indicate the presence of multiple primary tumours at a single site. See TNM rule no. 5. y Symbol. In those cases in which classification is performed during or following multimodality therapy, the cTNM or pTNM category is identified by a y prefix. The ycTNM or ypTNM categorizes the extent of tumour actually present at the time of that examination. The y categorization is not an estimate of the extent of tumour prior to multimodality therapy. r Symbol. Recurrent tumours, when classified after a disease free interval, are identified by the prefix r. a Symbol. The prefix a indicates that classification is first determined at autopsy. Optional Descriptors L – Lymphatic Invasion LX Lymphatic invasion cannot be assessed L0 No lymphatic invasion L1 Lymphatic invasion V – Venous Invasion VX Venous invasion cannot be assessed V0 No venous invasion V1 Microscopic venous invasion V2 Macroscopic venous invasion Note Macroscopic involvement of the wall of veins (with no tumour within the veins) is classified as V2. Pn – Perineural Invasion",
    "PnX Perineural invasion cannot be assessed Pn0 No perineural invasion Pn1 Perineural invasion Residual Tumour (R) Classification * The absence or presence of residual tumour after treatment is described by the symbol R. More details can be found in the TNM Supplement (see Preface, Reference 3). TNM and pTNM describe the anatomical extent of cancer in general without considering treatment. They can be supplemented by the R classification, which deals with tumour status after treatment. It reflects the effects of therapy, influences further therapeutic procedures, and is a strong predictor of prognosis. The definitions of the R categories are: RX Presence of residual tumour cannot be assessed R0 No residual tumour R1 Microscopic residual tumour R2 Macroscopic residual tumour. Note * Some consider the R classification to apply only to the primary tumour and its local or regional extent. Others have applied it more broadly to include distant metastasis. The specific usage should be indicated when the R is used. Stage and Prognostic Groups The TNM system is used to describe and record the anatomical extent of disease. For purposes of tabulation and analysis it is useful to condense these categories into groups. For consistency, in the TNM system, carcinoma in situ is categorized stage 0; in general, tumours localized to the organ of origin as stages I and II, locally extensive spread, particularly to regional lymph nodes as stage III, and those with distant metastasis as stage IV. The stage adopted is such as to ensure, as far as possible, that each group is more or less homogeneous in respect of survival, and that the survival rates of these groups for each cancer site are distinctive. For pathological stages, if sufficient tissue has been removed for pathological examination to evaluate the highest T and N categories, M1 may be either clinical (cM1) or pathological (pM1). However, if only a distant metastasis has had microscopic confirmation, the classification is pathological (pM1) and the stage is pathological. Although the anatomical extent of disease, as categorized by TNM, is a very powerful prognostic indicator in cancer, it is recognized that many factors have a significant impact",
    "on predicting outcomes. This has resulted in different stage groups. In thyroid cancer there are different stage definitions for different histologies and, new to this edition, in oropharyngeal cancer HPV related cancer is staged differently from non HPV related cancer. Some factors have been combined with TNM in the development of stage groupings; for instance, for different histologies (thyroid), different major prognostic factor groups (age in thyroid), and by aetiology (HPV related oropharyngeal cancer). In this edition the term stage has been used as defining the anatomical extent of disease while prognostic group for classifications that incorporate other prognostic factors. Historically, age in differentiated thyroid cancer and grade in soft tissue sarcoma are combined with anatomical extent of disease to determine stage, and stage is retained rather than prognostic group in these two sites. Prognostic Factors Classification Prognostic factors can be classified as those pertaining to: Anatomic extent of disease: describes the extent of disease in the patient at the time of diagnosis. Classically, this is TNM but may also include tumour markers that reflect tumour burden, for instance prostate specific antigen (PSA) in prostate carcinoma or carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in colorectal carcinoma. Tumour profile: this includes pathological (i.e., grade) and molecular features of a tumour, and gene expression patterns that reflect behaviour. These can be: predictive factors prognostic factors companion diagnostic marker. Patient profile: this includes terms related to the host of the cancer. These can be demographic factors, such as age and gender, or acquired, such as immunodeficiency and performance status. Environment: this may include treatment related and education (expertise, access, ageism, and healthcare delivery) and quality of management. When describing prognostic factors it is important to state what outcome the factors are prognostic for, and at what point in the patient trajectory. Anatomical extent of disease as described by TNM stage defines prognosis for survival. In the second edition of the UICC TNM Classification of Malignant Tumours for each tumour site, grids were developed that identified prognostic factors for survival at time of diagnosis and whether they were considered to be essential, additional, or new and promising. 16 The grids were updated for the third edition 17 and have been further updated and incorporated into the ninth edition of the UICC Manual of Clinical Oncology . 21 Essential factors are those that are required in addition to anatomical extent of disease to determine treatment as identified by published clinical practice guidelines. The table is a generic example of the prognostic factors summary grid. The grids from the ninth edition",
    "of the UICC Manual of Clinical Oncology are reproduced in this eighth edition. Grids are not available for some of the less common tumours.

Vermorken and Shao Hui Huang. © 2015 UICC. Published 2015 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Essential TNM Information on anatomical extent of disease at presentation or stage is central to cancer surveillance to determine cancer burden as it provides additional valuable information to incidence and mortality data. 22 However, cancer registries in low and middle income countries frequently have insufficient information to determine complete TNM data, either because of inability to perform necessary investigations or because of lack of recording of information. In view of this, the UICC TNM Project has with the International Agency for Research in Cancer and the National Cancer Institute developed a new classification system ‘Essential TNM’ that can be used to collect stage data when complete information is not available. To date, Essential TNM schemas have been developed for breast, cervix, colon, and prostate cancer, and are presented in this edition and available for download at www.uicc.org. Paediatric Tumours Since the fourth edition, the UICC TNM Classification of Malignant Tumours has not incorporated any classifications of paediatric tumours. This decision has stemmed from the lack of an international standard staging system for many paediatric tumours. To enable stage data collection by population based cancer registries there needs to be agreement on cancer staging. Recognition of this led to a consensus meeting held in 2014",
    "and resulted in the publication of recommendations on the staging of paediatric malignancies for the purposes of population surveillance. 23 The classifications published are not intended to replace the classifications used by the clinician when treating an individual patient but instead to facilitate the collection of stage by population based cancer registries. Related Classifications Since 1958, WHO has been involved in a programme aimed at providing internationally acceptable criteria for the histological diagnosis of tumours. This has resulted in the International Histological Classification of Tumours, which contains, in an illustrated multivolume series, definitions of tumour types and a proposed nomenclature. A new series, WHO Classification of Tumours – Pathology and Genetics of Tumours, continues this effort. (Information on these publications is at www.iarc.fr). The WHO International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD O 3) 19 is a coding system for neoplasms by topography and morphology and for indicating behaviour (e.g., malignant, benign). This coded nomenclature is identical in the morphology field for neoplasms to the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED). 24 In the interest of promoting national and international collaboration in cancer research and specifically of facilitating cooperation in clinical investigations, it is recommended that the WHO Classification of Tumours be used for classification and definition of tumour types and that the ICD O 3 code be used for storage and retrieval of data.

There should be histological confirmation of the disease. The anatomical subsite of origin should be recorded but is not considered in classification. In the case of multiple simultaneous primary tumours in one breast, the tumour with the highest T category should be used for classification. Simultaneous bilateral breast cancers should be classified independently to permit division of cases by histological type. The following are the procedures for assessing T, N, and M categories: T categories Physical examination and imaging, e.g., mammography N categories Physical examination and imaging M categories Physical examination and imaging Anatomical Subsites 1.

Axillary (ipsilateral): interpectoral (Rotter) nodes and lymph nodes along the axillary vein and its tributaries, which may be divided into the following levels: a. Level I (low axilla): lymph nodes lateral to the lateral border of pectoralis minor muscle b. Level II (mid axilla): lymph nodes between the medial and lateral borders of the pectoralis minor muscle and the interpectoral (Rotter) lymph nodes c. Level III (apical axilla): apical lymph nodes and those medial to the medial margin of the pectoralis minor muscle, excluding those designated as subclavicular or infraclavicular 2. Infraclavicular (subclavicular) (ipsilateral) 3. Internal mammary (ipsilateral): lymph nodes in the intercostal spaces along the edge of the sternum in the endothoracic fascia 4. Supraclavicular (ipsilateral) Note Intramammary lymph nodes are coded as axillary lymph nodes level I. Any other lymph node metastasis is coded as a distant metastasis (M1), including cervical or contralateral internal mammary lymph nodes.

When there are multiple foci of microinvasion, the size of only the largest focus is used to classify the microinvasion. (Do not use the sum of all individual foci.) The presence of multiple foci of microinvasion should be noted, as it is with multiple larger invasive carcinomas. c Invasion of the dermis alone does not qualify as T4. Chest wall includes ribs, intercostal muscles, and serratus anterior muscle but not pectoral muscle. d Inflammatory carcinoma of the breast is characterized by diffuse, brawny induration of the skin with an erysipeloid edge, usually with no underlying mass. If the skin biopsy is negative and there is no localized measurable primary cancer, the T category is pTX when pathologically staging a clinical inflammatory carcinoma (T4d). Dimpling of the skin, nipple retraction, or other skin changes, except those in T4b and T4d, may occur in T1, T2, or T3 without affecting the classification.",

Excisional biopsy of a lymph node or biopsy of a sentinel node, in the absence of assignment of a pT, is classified as a clinical N, e.g., cN1.

    "pT – Primary Tumour The pathological classification requires the examination of the primary carcinoma with no gross tumour at the margins of resection. A case can be classified pT if there is only microscopic tumour in a margin. The pT categories correspond to the T categories. Note When classifying pT the tumour size is a measurement of the invasive component. If there is a large in situ component (e.g., 4 cm) and a small invasive component (e.g., 0.5 cm), the tumour is coded pT1a. pN – Regional Lymph Nodes The pathological classification requires the resection and examination of at least the low axillary lymph nodes (level I) (see page 152). Such a resection will ordinarily include 6 or more lymph nodes. If the lymph nodes are negative, but the number ordinarily examined is not met, classify as pN0. pNX Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed (e.g., previously removed, or not removed for pathological study) pN0 No regional lymph node metastasis * Note * Isolated tumour cell clusters (ITC) are single tumour cells or small clusters of cells not more than 0.2 mm in greatest extent that can be detected by routine H and E stains or immunohistochemistry. An additional criterion has been proposed to include a cluster of fewer than 200 cells in a single histological cross section. Nodes containing only ITCs are excluded from the total positive node count for purposes of N classification and should be included in the total number of nodes evaluated.

These rules were then adopted, with minor modifications, by the newly formed Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d’Obstétrique (FIGO). Finally, UICC brought them into the TNM in order to correspond to the FIGO stages. FIGO, UICC, and AJCC work in close collaboration in the revision process. The classification of tumours of ovary and fallopian tube has been revised in line with the recent FIGO update. 1 Each site is described under the following headings: Rules for classification with the procedures for assessing T, N, and M categories; additional methods may be used when they enhance the accuracy of appraisal before treatment Anatomical subsites where appropriate Definition of the regional lymph nodes TNM clinical classification pTNM pathological classification Stage Prognostic grid Histopathological Grading",

There should be histological confirmation of the disease and division of cases by histological type. Histopathological grading is not applicable. The presence of elevated serum tumour markers, including alpha fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), is frequent in this disease. Staging is based on the determination of the anatomic extent of disease and assessment of serum tumour markers. The following are the procedures for assessing N, M, and S categories: N categories Physical examination and imaging M categories Physical examination, imaging, and biochemical tests",
    "S categories Serum tumour markers Stages are subdivided based on the presence and degree of elevation of serum tumour markers. Serum tumour markers are obtained immediately after orchiectomy and, if elevated, should be performed serially after orchiectomy according to the normal decay for AFP (half life 7days) and hCG (half life 3 days) to assess for serum tumour marker elevation. The S classification is based on the nadir value of hCG and AFP after orchiectomy. The serum level of LDH (but not its half life levels) has prognostic value in patients with metastatic disease and is included for staging. Regional Lymph Nodes The regional lymph nodes are the abdominal para aortic (periaortic), preaortic, interaortocaval, precaval, paracaval, retrocaval, and retroaortic nodes. Nodes along the spermatic vein should be considered regional. Laterality does not affect the N classification. The intrapelvic nodes and the inguinal nodes are considered regional after scrotal or inguinal surgery. TNM Clinical Classification T – Primary tumour Except for pTis and pT4, where radical orchiectomy is not always necessary for classification purposes, the extent of the primary tumour is classified after radical orchiectomy; see pT. In other circumstances, TX is used if no radical orchiectomy has been performed.

    "Hodgkin Lymphoma Introductory Notes The current staging classification for Hodgkin Lymphoma is a modification of the Ann Arbor classification first adopted in 1971. Over the past 45 years the practice has changed, making the previously used staging laparotomy and the resulting pathological staging classification obsolete. The recent consensus conference that took place in 2012 in Lugano suggested even more simplified system putting together stage I and II as Limited Stage and stage III and IV as Advanced Stage lymphoma. The Lugano Classification, a modification of the Ann Arbor classification, has been published and accepted by the UICC. 1 Clinical Staging (cS) It is determined by history, clinical examination, imaging, blood analysis, and the initial biopsy report. Bone marrow biopsy must be taken from a clinically or radiologically non involved area of bone. Liver Involvement Clinical evidence of liver involvement must include either enlargement of the liver and at least an abnormal serum alkaline phosphatase level and two different liver function test abnormalities, or an abnormal liver demonstrated by imaging and one abnormal liver function test. Spleen Involvement Clinical evidence of spleen involvement is accepted if there is palpable enlargement of the spleen confirmed by imaging. Lymphatic and Extralymphatic Disease The lymphatic structures are as follows: Lymph nodes Waldeyer ring Spleen Appendix Thymus Peyer patches The lymph nodes are grouped into regions and one or more (2, 3, etc.) may be involved.",
    "The spleen is designated S and extralymphatic organs or sites E. Lung Involvement Lung involvement limited to one lobe, or perihilar extension associated with ipsilateral lymphadenopathy, or unilateral pleural effusion with or without lung involvement but with hilar lymphadenopathy is considered as localized extralymphatic disease. Liver Involvement Liver involvement is always considered as diffuse extralymphatic disease. Clinical Stages (cS) Limited Stage Stage I Involvement of a single lymph node region (I), or localized involvement of a single extralymphatic organ or site (IE). Stage II Involvement of two or more lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm (II), or localized involvement of a single extralymphatic organ or site and its regional lymph node(s) with or without involvement of other contiguous lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm (IIE). Bulky Stage II Stage II disease with a single nodal mass greater than 10 cm in maximum dimension or greater than a third of the thoracic diameter as assessed on CT. Advanced Stage Stage III Involvement of lymph node regions on both sides of the diaphragm (III), which may also be accompanied by involvement of the spleen (IIIS). Stage IV Disseminated (multifocal) involvement of one or more extralymphatic organs, with or without associated lymph node involvement; or non contiguous extralymphatic organ involvement with involvement of lymph node regions on the same or both sides of the diaphragm. A and B Classification (Symptoms)",
    "Each stage should be divided into A and B according to the absence or presence of defined general symptoms. These are: 1. Unexplained weight loss of more than 10% of the usual body weight in the 6 months prior to first attendance 2. Unexplained fever with temperature above 38 °C 3. Night sweats Note Pruritus alone does not qualify for B classification nor does a short, febrile illness associated with a known infection. Reference 1 Cheson BD, Fisher RI, Barrington SF, et al.

    "Non ‐ Hodgkin Lymphomas The Lugano classification, a modification of the Ann Arbor classification, is recommended as for Hodgkin lymphoma with the exception of the elimination of the A or B classification of symptoms (see page 237). In Stage II disease, bulk is defined as larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension in follicular lymphoma, and 10 cm in largest dimension has been recommended for diffuse large cell lymphoma.",
    "Essential TNM Introductory Notes (see also page 13) When the T, N, and M categories have not been recorded in the clinical records or if the data to determine the categories is not available, the cancer registrar can code the extent of disease according to the Essential TNM scheme. Using the schema for breast, colorectal, prostate, or cervical cancer (Figures 2, 3, 4, and 5), the extent of disease may be recorded as Stage I, II, III, or IV or if insufficient data as distant, regional, or localized. Rules for Classification Essential TNM is composed of three key elements that together summarize the extent of cancer in the patient: M Presence or absence of distant metastasis N Presence or absence of regional lymph node metastasis/involvement T Extent of invasion and/or size of the tumour Coding the Elements of Essential TNM Metastasis (M) M + Presence of distant metastasis including non regional nodes M– No mention of distant metastases, clinically or pathologically Regional Node Metastasis/Involvement (N) R + Presence of regional node metastasis/involvement R– No mention of regional node metastases, clinically or pathologically Extent of Invasion and/or Size of Tumour (T) Depending on the information available, the T category can be recorded or if not available the extent of the local tumour as advanced or localized. A Extent of invasion and/or tumour size is Advanced A2 Extent of invasion and/or tumour size is very advanced A1 Extent of invasion and/or tumour size is advanced L Extent of invasion and/or tumour size is Limited L2 Extent of invasion and/or tumour size is limited L1 Extent of invasion and/or tumour size is very limited",

    "Paediatric Tumours Introductory Notes (see also page 13) The classifications in this section are not intended to replace the classifications used by the clinician when treating an individual patient but to facilitate the collection of stage by population based cancer registries. The consensus meeting held in 2014 recommended a tiered staging system with more detailed systems for well resourced cancer registries and less detailed systems for registries with limited recourses and access; as with Essential TNM, lower tiered systems are based on collapsing higher tiered systems. 1 The recommendations for tier 1 and 2 follow. Well resourced registries may choose to collect additional accepted prognostic factors such as those used in the clinical setting but these are not included in this section. For some cancers, recommendations are the same as described earlier for adult patients and the appropriate page number is given; others are referenced where appropriate. Rules for the derivation of paediatric cancer stage in population based cancer registries are being developed and will be available from the UICC website when available. 2 Rules for Classification The classification applies only to paediatric malignant tumours. Gastrointestinal Tumours Hepatoblastoma Tier 1 and 2 Metastatic Distant metastases present Localized Tumour confined to the liver including regional lymph nodes Well resourced cancer registries may wish to use the Pretext Classification. 3 Bone and Soft Tissue Tumours Osteosarcoma Tier 1 and 2 Metastatic Distant metastases present Localized Tumour confined to area of origin including regional lymph nodes",
