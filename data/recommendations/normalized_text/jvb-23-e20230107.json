    "Deep vein thrombosis: diagnosis and treatment 2/27 Sobreira et al. J Vasc Bras. 2024;23:e20230107. https://doi.org/10.1590/1677-5449.202301072 INTRODUCTION Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is characterized by thrombus formation within the deep veins, with partial obstruction or occlusion, and is more common in the lower extremities – in 80-95% of cases. 1, 2 The main complications resulting from this disease are chronic venous insufficiency/post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) (edema and/or pain in the lower extremities, pigmentation changes, skin ulceration) and pulmonary embolism (PE). The latter is of high clinical importance, as it has a high mortality rate. 1,2 Approximately 5% to 15% of individuals with untreated DVT may die of PE. 3 DVT or PE may occur in 2 per 1000 person-years, with a recurrence rate of up to 25%. 3 Prompt initiation of diagnostic investigations and treatment is crucial to avoid these complications. RISK FACTORS The main factors directly associated with the genesis of thrombi are blood stasis, endothelial injury, and hypercoagulable states. 2 Therefore, risk factors for DVT include advanced age, cancer, surgical procedures, immobilization, estrogen use, pregnancy-puerperal cycle, and inherited or acquired hypercoagulable states. 3, 4 Its incidence increases proportionally with age, suggesting that this is the most important determinant of a first thrombotic event. 5 For didactic purposes, risk factors can be classified as follows: 6 - Inherited/idiopathic: activated protein C resistance (mainly factor V Leiden); prothrombin gene G20210A mutation; antithrombin deficiency; protein C deficiency; protein S deficiency; elevated factor VIII levels; and increased fibrinogen levels; - Acquired/provoked: antiphospholipid syndrome (APS); cancer; paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria; age > 65 years; overweight and obesity; pregnancy and puerperium; myeloproliferative diseases (eg, polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia); nephrotic syndrome; hyperviscosity (eg, in Waldenström macroglobulinemia and multiple myeloma); Behçet’s disease; trauma; surgery; immobilization; and estrogen therapy. CLASSIFICATION Lower extremity DVT is divided according to its location into: - Proximal: when it involves the iliac and/or femoral and/or popliteal veins; - Distal: when it involves the veins located below the popliteal vein. The risk of PE and magnitude of PTS are greater when resulting from proximal DVT. However, there is an up to 20% risk of progression of distal DVT to proximal segments, which makes its diagnosis and treatment similar to that of proximal DVT. 7 Therefore, classifying the type of suspected DVT is important to guide treatment strategies. DIAGNOSIS Physical examination When present, the main signs and symptoms are pain, edema, erythema, cyanosis, dilated superficial veins, elevated body temperature, and muscle cramps. 7 The main factors related to the development of DVT, associated with pain and edema, can be grouped into clinical prediction models. 8 No clinical assessment alone is sufficient to diagnose or rule out DVT, 1 as clinical findings are related to the disease in only 50% of cases. 2 Existing literature recommends history taking and physical examination, combined with laboratory tests and imaging. 1,8, 9 The best studied clinical DVT prediction system is the Wells score (WS). 9,10 Wells score (WS) WS is a clinical prediction model based on signs and symptoms, risk factors, and alternative diagnoses that estimates the pretest probability of DVT ( Table 1 ). This score has proven useful in the initial management of patients with suspected DVT. 8,9,1 2 In its first version, WS categorizes patients into low, moderate, and high probability of DVT with a prevalence of 5% (95% CI, 4-8%), 17% (95% CI, 13-23%), and 53% (95% CI, 44-61%), respectively. 10 WS should be used in combination with additional diagnostic methods, such as color Doppler ultrasound (CDU) with compression of the entire lower-extremity venous system (patients with a high probability WS), and measurement of D-dimer (DD) (patients with a low probability WS). 1, 9 A negative CDU followed by a negative DD test result allows us to safely rule out DVT. 8 Geersing et al., 8 in a meta-analysis, defined that, in patients with a WS ≤ 1 and a negative DD test result, the probability of DVT is less than 2% and it can be safely excluded in different groups of patients, except for those with cancer and recurrent DVT. WS produces better results in the assessment of young patients without comorbidities or previous history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than in other patients. 1 3 For recurrent DVT, it is recommended",
    "Deep vein thrombosis: diagnosis and treatment 3/27 Sobreira et al. J Vasc Bras. 2024;23:e20230107. https://doi.org/10.1590/1677-5449.202301072 to use the modified WS (adding one extra point to patients with prior history of DVT). 8 Laboratory testing DD in the diagnosis and monitoring of VTE DD is a molecular marker that results from the dissolution of fibrin. It is usually elevated in thrombotic events, but it can also be elevated in other situations such as pregnancy, cancer, trauma, infection, and other pro-inflammatory processes. 1 The sensitivity of this marker ranges from 94% to 100%, so the absence of elevated serum DD levels rules out a diagnosis of DVT in 97% to 98% of cases. DD levels are grouped into negative (< 350 ng/mL), intermediate (351-500 ng/ mL), and positive (> 500 ng/mL). 13,14 DD levels increase with increasing age, which reduces the specificity of the test. A systematic review published in 2014 demonstrated the need for an age- adjust DD (age multiplied by 10 mcg/L) in patients older than 50 years, and this increased specificity without changing the sensitivity of the laboratory test. 1 4 DD levels also increase with pregnancy, which can reduce the specificity of the test if DD measurement is necessary in a possible diagnosis of DVT. 14,1 5 In a small sample of asymptomatic women, none of the pregnant women had DD levels lower than 0.50 mg/L in the third trimester, and the authors concluded that higher thresholds should be used for the first (0.75 mg/L), second (1 mg/L), and third (1.5 mg/L) trimesters. 16 Recommendation 1 When combined with a negative DD test result, it is possible to rule out DVT in patients who have a low probability WS. Class I, level A 8 DD and the risk of VTE In critically ill hospitalized patients, elevated DD is associated with an increased risk of VTE, regardless of age, sex, race, body mass index, and clinical disease. 1 7 The MAGELLAN trial evaluated 7581 critically ill hospitalized patients and observed that the incidence of VTE was 3.5 times higher in patients with serum DD levels greater than or equal to twice the upper limit of normal (odds ratio [OR] 2.29; 95% CI, 1.75-2.98). 1 7 In the general population, elevated DD was associated with an increased risk of a first VTE episode in a study evaluating 923 patients during 8 years of follow-up. 18 In patients with cancer, DD levels are considerably elevated in patients presenting with a first episode of VTE. 1 9 In a study of 821 patients with cancer, a 2-fold increase in DD levels was associated with a 1.3-fold increase in the incidence of VTE both in univariate (95% CI, 1.1-1.5; p<0.001) and multivariate analysis (hazard ratio [HR] 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2-1.6; p<0.001). 2 0 The association between elevated DD and the occurrence of a first VTE episode has been validated in several studies, including colorectal, lung, and gynecologic cancer. 21 DD and VTE recurrence Regarding VTE recurrence and DD levels, there is a representative systematic review, involving 1888 patients with a first episode of unprovoked VTE, which demonstrated that patients who maintained an elevated DD level after discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy had an annual rate of recurrent VTE of 8.9%, compared with 3.5% in patients with a normal DD level. 2 2 A meta- analysis of the same population showed an annual rate of recurrent VTE of 8.8% in patients with an elevated DD level, compared with 3.7% in patients with a normal DD level. 2 3 A recent study demonstrated an association between elevated DD levels and the risk of recurrent VTE from 3 weeks (HR 1.4; 1.06-1.84) up to 15 months (HR 1.26; 1.01-1. 57) after discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy. 2 4 Although there are no international or national guidelines advising the maintenance or discontinuation of anticoagulants based on DD levels, it is recommended that DD levels be measured 1 month after discontinuing anticoagulant therapy. If the DD level remains elevated, it is necessary to consider the results of these 2 articles that demonstrate an almost 2-fold higher incidence of recurrent VTE in patients with elevated DD levels than in those with normal levels. Recommendation 2 Persistently elevated serum DD levels after stopping anticoagulation may indicate risk of recurrence, but Table 1. Thrombolytic therapy plus anticoagulation compared with anticoagulation alone in patients with extensive proximal DVT.

J Vasc Bras. 2024;23:e20230107. https://doi.org/10.1590/1677-5449.202301072 they do not predict greater or lesser risk of recurrence of a thrombotic event. Class I, level A. 23 DD and COVID-19 The discussion about DD and the risk of VTE has gained special attention due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as high DD levels were observed in patients with COVID-19, mainly due to its pro-inflammatory nature and vascular and endothelial involvement. A randomized trial, the HEP-COVID, recruited patients with COVID-19 with DD levels more than 4 times the upper limit of normal and randomized them to receive low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) at prophylactic doses vs therapeutic doses. The group of patients with COVID-19 receiving full-dose anticoagulation had a VTE incidence of 10.9% vs 29.0% in the group of patients receiving prophylactic-dose anticoagulation (relative risk [RR] 0.37; 95% CI, 0.21-0.66; p<0.001). Furthermore, patients receiving full-dose anticoagulation had lower mortality rates (19.4%) than those receiving prophylactic-dose anticoagulation (25.0%), (RR 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.96; p=0.03). 25 Some studies and meta-analyses have shown an association between elevated DD and COVID-19 mortality, whose pathophysiologic mechanism is associated with a secondary state of fibrinolytic hyperactivity or exacerbated fibrin consumption. 2 6 A meta- analysis published in 2021 found an association between elevated DD and mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with lower probability of discharge and greater progression to orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, showing that elevated DD levels on admission would indicate an increased pro-inflammatory state, with maximal activation of the interleukin cascade and a state of hyperfibrinolysis. 2 7 Another meta-analysis from 2021 evaluated 10,491 patients with COVID-19 and showed a strong association between elevated DD levels and poor prognosis of the disease (OR 3.39; 95% CI, 2.66-4.33; p<0.00001). 2 8 In short, elevated DD levels on the admission of patients with COVID-19 are associated with poor prognosis, increased risk of VTE, progression to mechanical ventilation, and death. There is no reference threshold for DD levels; however, some studies suggest that levels above 2.0 μg/mL on admission could be a predictor of poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. 29 In summary, serum DD levels in patients with COVID-19 play a critical role in evaluating coagulation status, inflammation, and risk of complications such as thrombosis and disease severity. However, the results should be interpreted considering the individual clinical setting and other clinical markers, and clinical decision-making should be guided by experienced health care professionals. DD and PTS PTS is one of the most harmful complications of lower extremity DVT due to its morbidity, with an impact on patients’ quality of life and socioeconomic activities. Despite being a predictor of the inflammatory process and thrombotic activity, DD levels in the follow-up of patients with VTE are not associated with the development of PTS, as documented in several studies in the literature. 30,31 Residual thrombus detected on CDU, partial or absent venous recanalization, type of anticoagulant administered during DVT treatment, popliteal reflux, and advanced age remain the main determining risk factors for PTS. In summary, DD plays a key role in the diagnosis, monitoring, and assessment of VTE risk in various clinical settings. DD levels can be influenced by different factors, such as age and underlying medical conditions, and their prognostic value varies depending on the clinical scenario. Therefore, proper interpretation of DD test results is critical to guide the diagnosis and treatment of patients with VTE and other medical conditions. Imaging CDU Venous CDU is the most commonly used complementary method for diagnosing DVT in symptomatic patients. It is less accurate in distal veins, in upper extremity veins, and in asymptomatic patients. 7,9,32,3 3 It is currently the imaging modality of choice for diagnosing DVT, 7,9,3 4 with sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 98% to 100%, 3 5 replacing venography. 7,32,35,36 Real-time ultrasonography is used to assess the absence or presence of vein compressibility and intraluminal echogenicity. CDU evaluates venous anatomy and venous flow characteristics, combining real-time imaging and spectral analysis. 7,9,3 7 Examination of the entire lower-extremity venous system is preferred over segmental examination or point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS), although the issue is still controversial in certain institutions. 38 In patients with a high probability WS, negative CDU, and positive DD, CDU should be repeated after 3 to 7 days. In cases of recurrent ipsilateral DVT, the criteria used for diagnosis by CDU are as follows: increase in diameter of the same affected segment ≥ 4 mm, increase of 9 cm in thrombus length, or occurrence in a venous segment other than that previously affected. 3 6 CDU can distinguish between",

J Vasc Bras. 2024;23:e20230107. https://doi.org/10.1590/1677-5449.202301072 non-vascular pathologic processes, such as inguinal adenopathy, Baker’s cyst, abscess, and hematoma, among others. In the follow-up of patients diagnosed with acute DVT, the 2018 Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound consensus recommends using the term “chronic post- thrombotic change” instead of “chronic DVT” to avoid confusion with current DVT. It also recommends caution when using the term “subacute DVT” due to the difficulty in characterizing it. 39,40 CDU plays a key role in the diagnosis of DVT, providing high sensitivity and specificity. It is also useful in the follow-up of patients with acute DVT, allowing differentiation from other non-vascular conditions. The recommended terminology for describing chronic post-thrombotic changes is intended to avoid confusion in medical communication. CDU combined with serum DD measurement is commonly used for the diagnosis and confirmation of DVT. The sensitivity and specificity of this combination may vary depending on clinical circumstances, diagnostic criteria, and DD cutoff levels. However, in general: 1. Sensitivity: CDU combined with DD measurement is known to have high sensitivity. This means that most DVT cases are correctly identified by this approach. Sensitivity may vary, but many studies report sensitivity greater than 90% for the diagnosis of DVT; 2. Specificity: The specificity of the CDU and DD combination is generally high but may be lower than the sensitivity. This is because elevated DD levels can occur in several medical conditions other than DVT, such as infections, inflammation, and chronic diseases. Therefore, although specificity may vary, values above 80% are commonly found for this combination. It is important to highlight that the DD cutoff levels can affect the sensitivity and specificity of the approach. Lower cutoff levels will increase sensitivity but may decrease specificity, whereas higher cutoff levels will increase specificity but may decrease sensitivity. Recommendation 3 Moderate or low probability WS associated with normal serum DD levels may preclude the need for CDU to exclude the diagnosis. Class II, level C. 23 Recommendation 4 High probability WS associated with elevated serum DD levels suggest the need for CDU to confirm the diagnosis. Class II, level C. 23 Venography/phlebography Phlebography is considered the gold standard for diagnosing DVT and is currently used only when other tests are unable to define the diagnosis. However, it is not the routine test for suspected DVT due to several limitations, such as high cost, adverse reactions to contrast agents, discomfort for the patient, contraindication for patients with renal failure, and use of radiation. It has limited accuracy in cases of recurrent DVT. 1 Phlebography may be useful in cases where CDU suggests the presence of proximal obstruction by demonstrating loss of flow phasicity, but the thrombus cannot be visualized in the iliac veins. 41 Computed tomography angiography (CTA) Because the sensitivity and specificity of CTA are similar to those of CDU, there is insufficient evidence to recommend it as an initial diagnostic modality for DVT. 3 6 In a meta-analysis, Thomas et al. 4 2 found a sensitivity of 96% (95% CI, 93-98%) and a specificity of 95% (95% CI, 94-97%) for CTA in the diagnosis of proximal DVT in patients with suspected PE. It may be useful for patients with suspected DVT, in whom CDU cannot be used due to technical limitations or suspected venous anomaly. 36 The use of CTA has the advantage of imaging the pelvic veins and inferior vena cava (IVC), whose imaging is limited in CDU, in addition to detecting other etiologies of lower extremity edema, such as pelvic neoplasms or extrinsic compression by other vascular structures, including the compression of the left common iliac vein (May-Thurner syndrome). 4 3 Peterson et al. 4 4 demonstrated that, although the sensitivity is high (93%), producing a negative predictive value of 97%, the ability of venous CTA to diagnose DVT has a specificity of 71%, giving a positive predictive value of only 53%; other researchers have shown a 50% false-positive rate for venous CTA in pelvic DVT. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) MRA can be used to diagnose DVT in cases where CDU provides inconclusive results. 36,4 5 The accuracy is similar to that of CDU in the diagnosis of DVT of the iliocaval segment. 42,4 6 MRA with direct thrombus imaging, based on the paramagnetic properties of methemoglobin, may be the imaging modality of choice for suspected acute recurrent DVT, distinguishing between an old and a new event. 36 Studies comparing MRA vs phlebography found sensitivity and specificity of up to 100% for MRA in the diagnosis of femoropopliteal DVT, but accuracy was lower for distal DVT. For proximal DVT,",
    "Deep vein thrombosis: diagnosis and treatment 6/27 Sobreira et al. J Vasc Bras. 2024;23:e20230107. https://doi.org/10.1590/1677-5449.202301072 MRA has an accuracy similar to that of CDU and phlebography, with the advantage of high detection rates of proximal extension of the thrombosis and isolated pelvic DVT. 47 Despite excellent accuracy for detecting acute DVT, MRA has several disadvantages. It requires patients to remain still for long imaging times and cannot be used in patients with metal devices or clips. The contrast used (gadolinium) can be toxic in patients with renal dysfunction, and the need for frequent imaging may lead to institutional issues in larger facilities. Finally, MRA quality depends on the institution’s technical experience. 47 In summary, venography/phlebography is the gold standard but reserved for cases in which other tests do not provide a diagnosis. CTA has sensitivity and specificity similar to those of CDU, while MRA is useful in cases of inconclusive CDU results and can distinguish between an old and a new event in recurrence. The choice of modality depends on patients’ clinical circumstances and technical and safety limitations. CTA or MRA (compared with venography) can be performed when it is not possible to perform CDU. TREATMENT Anticoagulation in the acute event (conventional patients) The treatment of DVT poses a challenge and is based on the use of anticoagulants to prevent thrombus progression while the activation of primary fibrinolytic mechanisms promotes its dissolution. 48-5 1 The choice of initial anticoagulant includes availability, familiarity of use by the medical team, pharmacokinetic and dynamic characteristics, patient comorbidities, ease of reversing its effect, and even patient preference and cost. 5 2 Currently, unfractionated heparin (UFH), LMWH, fondaparinux, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are available for use in Brazil. No anticoagulant is completely safe with respect to bleeding. Therefore, in clinical practice, the risk of bleeding should always be assessed when treating VTE. Different anticoagulants may present different risks for bleeding depending on the intensity of treatment, concomitant use of other anticoagulants, thrombolytics, or antiplatelets, and patient characteristics and comorbidities. 53 Recommendation 5 In patients with proximal DVT, the preferred approach is generally to use anticoagulant therapy as primary treatment rather than combining it with thrombolytic therapy. Class II, level C. 11,53,54 Duration of anticoagulation The goal of prolonging treatment duration is to prevent DVT recurrence. The risk is decreased if DVT occurs in the presence of reversible risk factors, such as surgery, and increased if DVT is idiopathic or associated with cancer. Patients with symptomatic PE also have a higher risk of recurrence than those with DVT alone. The risk also increases in the presence of other complications, such as homozygous inherited thrombophilia, APS, or a combination of thrombophilias. 53 Initial anticoagulation of acute lower extremity DVT For patients with a high clinical suspicion of DVT, it is recommended to start treatment with anticoagulants while awaiting confirmation of the diagnosis, as long as there is no contraindication. 5 4 In most patients with proximal DVT, anticoagulant therapy alone is suggested rather than in combination with thrombolytic therapy (conditional recommendation, low-certainty evidence), as shown in Table 1 . Notes Patients with the leg threatened by DVT may require thrombolysis. Using DOACs instead of VKAs is suggested in patients with VTE (conditional recommendation, moderate-certainty evidence) ( Table 2 ). The recommendation does not apply to all patients, such as to patients with triple-positive APS – when DOACs are contraindicated. One DOAC is not suggested over another. We recommend, with a high level of evidence, initial treatment with subcutaneous (SC) LMWH, intravenous (IV) or monitored SC UFH, fixed-dose Table 2. DOACs compared with VKAs for VTE.

J Vasc Bras. 2024;23:e20230107. https://doi.org/10.1590/1677-5449.202301072 SC UFH, or SC fondaparinux, followed by long-term oral anticoagulation. The initial treatment (UFH, LMWH, or fondaparinux) should last for at least 5 days, combined with VKAs from the first treatment day, until the international normalized ratio (INR) is at a therapeutic level (between 2.0 and 3.0) for 2 consecutive days, when parenteral drugs can be safely discontinued. We do not recommend, under any circumstances, initial treatment of DVT with VKAs alone, as they are associated with high rates of symptomatic recurrence and risk of skin necrosis. An alternative to VKAs is the use of DOACs, such as edoxaban and dabigatran, starting on day 5 after heparinization, or apixaban or rivaroxaban without the need for an initial parenteral anticoagulant bridge. LMWH LMWHs have predictable bioavailability; therefore, routine monitoring with anti-factor Xa level measurements is not recommended. 42,4 5 However, blood tests with platelet counts should be performed. They can be administered once or twice daily, in hospital or at home. LMWH vs warfarin Long-term treatment (more than 35 days) with LMWH is as effective as with warfarin in preventing deaths and VTE recurrence, with a similar risk of bleeding. LMWH vs UFH In prolonged treatment (3 to 6 months), compared with UFHs, LMWHs are associated with a lower risk of major bleeding and recurrence of proximal DVT, with fewer adverse effects. In patients with acute PE, LMWHs are as effective and safe as UFHs. In patients with acute DVT and severe renal failure, treatment with UFH rather than LMWH is suggested. IV UFH If IV UFH is the initial treatment of choice, we recommend that, after the IV bolus (80 U/kg or 5000 U), it be administered via continuous infusion (initially at a dose of 18 U/kg/h or 1300 U/h) with dose adjustment to achieve and maintain an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) between 1.5 and 2.5 above baseline. SC UFH If fixed-dose SC UFH is used, we recommend an initial dose of 333 U/kg followed by 250 U/kg twice daily, with treatment according to the patient’s body weight, with dose adjustment to achieve and maintain an aPTT between 1.5 and 2.5 above baseline. LMWH vs fondaparinux Fondaparinux is noninferior to LMWH in terms of VTE recurrence, major bleeding, or death. VKAs VKAs should be initiated on the first treatment day, combined with UFH, LMWH, or fondaparinux, except in patients who have contraindications to their use. Treatment with VKAs requires frequent INR testing and monitoring of food and drug interactions. Warfarin Achieving a therapeutic INR level (between 2.0 and 3.0) as soon as possible is important, as it reduces the duration of parenteral anticoagulation and costs. Although a dose of 5 mg tends to prevent excessive anticoagulation, an initial dose of 10 mg may more rapidly achieve a therapeutic INR level. In a systematic review evaluating the effectiveness of warfarin at an initial dose of 10 mg compared with 5 mg in patients with VTE, no differences were observed between the two doses in terms of VTE recurrence, minor or major bleeding, or length of hospital stay. There is no advantage of gradual over abrupt withdrawal of warfarin in terms of preventing VTE recurrence. DOACs In recent years, 4 DOACs – rivaroxaban, edoxaban, apixaban, and dabigatran – have been made available on the Brazilian market, with some advantages over VKAs, such as fixed dose, fewer drug and food interactions, rapid onset of action, short half-life, and no need for regular monitoring. 55,56 Rivaroxaban Rivaroxaban is a molecule, with a molecular weight of 436 g/mol. 2 0 Its mechanism of action consists of direct inhibition of factor Xa. 5 7 The drug is rapidly absorbed orally, reaching maximum plasma concentration 2 to 4 hours following its administration, with a half-life of 6 to 7 hours. 56,5 7 Rivaroxaban is metabolized in the liver, and its use should be avoided in individuals with moderate-to-severe liver disease. 56,5 8 It is excreted through the kidneys, 10,1 3 and its dose should be adjusted in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and creatinine clearance (CrCl) between 15 and 50 mL/ min – its use is not recommended with CrCl < 15 mL/ min. 1 3 Rivaroxaban interacts with P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4 inhibitors. 59,60 The Einstein DVT study showed that rivaroxaban is as effective as LMWH and warfarin in treating DVT in terms of recurrence rates (2.1% vs 3.0%; p<0.001 for",

The Einstein EXTENSION and Einstein CHOICE studies also demonstrated the feasibility of its use, with a low risk of major bleeding with prolonged use (up to 12 months). The usual regimen without renal failure is 15 mg orally every 12 hours for the first 21 days, followed by 20 mg orally once daily for the intended treatment duration. 56,61,6 2 There is no need for concomitant parenteral drug initially. Its anticoagulant effect can be reversed by andexanet alfa. 57,61,62 Edoxaban Edoxaban is an oral anticoagulant that directly inhibits factor Xa. 63,6 4 It is predominantly absorbed from the duodenum and proximal jejunum, 65-6 7 and can be administered with food. 68,6 9 It is absorbed within 1 to 2 hours, with a half-life of 5.8 to 10.7 hours. 70-7 5 The recommended dose is 60 mg once daily, starting after 5 days of treatment with UFH or LMWH. 76,7 7 Its use is contraindicated in patients with CrCl < 15 mL/ min. 7 8 Edoxaban has potential for use in children (considering preclinical phase I studies). 79,80 The Hokusai-VTE study showed that, after initial treatment with heparin, edoxaban was noninferior to standard heparin and warfarin therapy. 74,8 1 Edoxaban was more effective than warfarin in patients aged ≥ 75 years and in those with multiple comorbidities. 74,7 5 Edoxaban has also been shown to be effective and safe in the treatment of cancer-associated VTE. 80,8 2 Its dose should be reduced to 30 mg once daily in patients with moderate loss of renal function (CrCl of 15-50 mL/ min), weighing less than or equal to 60 kg, or using P-glycoprotein inhibitors. Apixaban Apixaban is an oral anticoagulant, a direct factor Xa inhibitor. It was approved for medical use in Brazil in July 2011 for the treatment and secondary prevention of VTE. 83-8 5 It is predominantly absorbed from the duodenum and proximal jejunum. 86-8 8 Maximum plasma concentration is achieved 3 to 4 hours following its administration, with a half-life of 6 hours. 86,87,89-9 1 Laboratory monitoring is not required. 92,9 3 For treatment in the acute phase of VTE, a dose of 10 mg orally twice daily for 5 days is recommended, followed by 5 mg twice daily. 91,94,9 5 There is no need for concomitant use of parenteral anticoagulants. For extended VTE treatment beyond 6 months of initial anticoagulation, a dose of 2.5 mg orally twice daily can be used to reduce recurrence. 87,96-9 8 There are no adequate data on its use in pregnant and breastfeeding women. 9 9 Safety and efficacy have not yet been established in patients aged < 18 years. 87,98-10 0 It is not recommended for use in patients with severe liver failure. 8 7 Dose adjustment based solely on renal function is not required in the treatment of VTE, but it is contraindicated in patients with CrCl < 15 mL/min. 87,100 Dabigatran Dabigatran etexilate is a reversible inhibitor of the thrombin active site. Laboratory monitoring is not required. Its use is not recommended for patients with renal failure with CrCl < 30 mL/min. Like other DOACs, it is contraindicated in patients with advanced liver disease. 101 The RE-COVER, RE-COVER II, RE-MEDY, and RE-SONATE studies observed noninferiority of dabigatran to standard warfarin therapy in the treatment of PE (fatal or nonfatal), PE, and/or recurrent DVT after an initial course of 5 to 10 days of parenteral anticoagulation. Maximum plasma concentration is achieved 0.5 to 2 hours following its administration, with peak plasma concentration after 6 hours and a half-life of 11 hours. Bleeding is the most important side effect. Its action can be reversed by idarucizumab. Additionally, dabigatran can be cleared by hemodialysis. Concomitant use with P-glycoprotein inducers should be avoided. It should be initiated after at least 5 days of parenteral anticoagulation at a dose of 150 mg orally every 12 hours throughout the treatment period. 101,102 Recommendation 6 The preferential use of DOACs instead of VKAs can be recommended in the initial treatment of VTE. Class II, level B 11,53,54 Uncomplicated, unprovoked VTE in healthy patients Home anticoagulation, preferably with DOACs, without the need for hospital admission. After the initial treatment of unprovoked DVT or PE, an indefinite period of anticoagulation is suggested (conditional recommendation, moderate-certainty evidence), as shown in Table 3 . Notes It does not apply to patients at high risk of bleeding. For patients with DVT and/or PE who will continue to receive a DOAC for secondary prevention, the use of a standard-dose DOAC or reduced-dose DOAC (rivaroxaban 10 mg/day or apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily) is suggested.

J Vasc Bras. 2024;23:e20230107. https://doi.org/10.1590/1677-5449.202301072 especially in those with moderate-to-severe CKD (CrCl between 15 and 59 mL/min) or end-stage CKD (CrCl < 15 mL/min). 114 Patients with CKD and VTE are traditionally treated with IV UFH followed by warfarin, with a target INR between 2.0 and 3.0. 11 5 For patients with VTE and end-stage CKD (CrCl < 15 mL/min), LMWHs, fondaparinux, and DOACs are not recommended. 115,11 6 In moderate-to-severe CKD (CrCl between 15 and 59 mL/min), LMWHs or fondaparinux may eventually be prescribed with caution, in an adjusted dose, with monitoring of anti-factor Xa levels, or not recommended to avoid bioaccumulation and bleeding, particularly in advanced CKD (CrCl < 30 mL/min). 115,117 The efficacy and safety of DOACs, with possible dose adjustment, were confirmed in the initial and extended treatment of VTE in patients with VTE and mild-to-moderate CKD (CrCl between 30 and 80 mL/min). 11 5 Edoxaban is the only DOAC with a recommendation for dose reduction in the acute treatment of VTE for patients with CKD (CrCl between 30 and 50 mL/min), from 60 to 30 mg orally once daily, while maintaining the same efficacy and safety. 118 Regular reassessment of renal function is essential in these patients. Anticoagulation in acute VTE in women In high-income countries, where the classic causes of maternal death during pregnancy have been controlled, such as eclampsia and bleeding, VTE has become the main concern, and its prevention, supported by evidence-based guidelines with the use of pharmacological prophylaxis in selected patients, is still the best strategy to reduce this potentially fatal complication. The choice of contraceptive methods and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) should be made through careful selection by evaluating eligibility criteria, contraindications, and patient autonomy. Both indiscriminate use and unreasonable prohibition are inappropriate approaches. Hormonal contraceptives and HRT increase the risk of VTE; however, women should not be deprived of its benefits, in addition to contraception, which give women more freedom during their childbearing years and make them less symptomatic during perimenopause. Assisted reproduction and hormone therapy (HT) in transgender women are also associated with the development of VTE, and its prevention will depend on correct indication and adequate prophylaxis in those patients considered at high risk for developing this disease. VTE in the pregnancy-puerperal cycle Pregnant women have all 3 etiopathogenic components of Virchow’s triad: a) venous stasis, caused by compression of the IVC and left common iliac vein by the pregnant uterus and by reduced venous tone resulting from the myorelaxant action of progesterone; b) hypercoagulability, secondary to the induction of hepatic synthesis of coagulation factors VII, VIII, and X by placental estriol, increased levels of fibrinogen and plasminogen activator inhibitors I and II, and reduced protein S synthesis; and c) endothelial injury, which occurs during nidation, endovascular remodeling of the uterine spiral arteries, and expulsion of the placenta. 119,120 During pregnancy, there is a 5- to 10-fold increase in the risk of VTE, and it can be 35 times higher in the puerperium compared with the rate among non- pregnant women of the same age. After childbirth, its prevalence decreases rapidly; but there is a residual risk for up to about 12 weeks. Approximately two-thirds of DVTs occur during pregnancy, distributed equally across the 3 trimesters. However, 43% to 60% of PE episodes occur in the first 6 weeks postpartum. 119,120 Among pregnant women, compared with non- pregnant women, DVTs are even more prevalent in the left lower extremity (90% vs 55%) and in the iliofemoral segment (72% vs 9%). This is due to the marked compression of the vena cava and left common iliac vein against the fifth lumbar vertebra, caused by the growing pregnant uterus. 119,120 The main risk factors for VTE during pregnancy and puerperium are as follows: overweight; obesity; age 35 years or over; inherited or acquired thrombophilia; long-distance travel; immobility; hospital admission during pregnancy; multiparity; smoking; comorbidities, such as inflammatory bowel disease; urinary tract infection; systemic lupus erythematosus; pregnancy- induced hypertension or preeclampsia; non-obstetric antepartum surgery; bleeding; blood transfusion; and hyperemesis gravidarum; among others. Prevention of VTE in pregnancy, through the application of evidence- based guidelines or risk assessment models and the implementation of mechanical and/or pharmacological prophylaxis, is still the best strategy to reduce the rate of these events. 119,120 Peculiarities of anticoagulant therapy during pregnancy and puerperium. Administration of warfarin at 6 to 12 weeks’ gestation can induce fetal embryopathy (nasal hypoplasia and/or stippled epiphyses), central nervous system abnormalities (dorsal midline dysplasia with agenesis of the corpus callosum, midline cerebellar atrophy, ventral midline dysplasia with optic atrophy and amaurosis, and bleeding), and fetal bleeding. 12 1 However, warfarin is safe and can",

J Vasc Bras. 2024;23:e20230107. https://doi.org/10.1590/1677-5449.202301072 be prescribed during breastfeeding. 12 1 DOACs are contraindicated in pregnancy, because they cross the placental barrier, and in breastfeeding, because they pass into breast milk. 12 1 Therefore, VTE should be treated during these periods preferably with UFH, or with LMWH if there are restrictions on the use of UFH. 122 The use of fondaparinux during pregnancy has a restricted indication and low-quality evidence – the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) recommendation was generally grade 2C, indicating a moderate grade of recommendation based on low- quality evidence or consensus opinion of experts. 54,84 Recommendation 14 During pregnancy and breastfeeding, we recommend against the use of DOACs. For the treatment of VTE during pregnancy, UFH or LMWH are recommended. Class I, level B (UFH x LMWH) and Class I, level A (LMWH x VKA) 54,84,121,122 Choice of mode of delivery in women on anticoagulation therapy The choice of the mode of delivery is obstetric. There is no contraindication to artificial cervical ripening or labor induction. The delivery of a pregnant woman receiving anticoagulation should be scheduled at 37 to 40 weeks’ gestation. 12 3 LMWHs should be discontinued 12 hours before delivery if administered at prophylactic doses, or 24 hours before delivery if administered at intermediate or therapeutic doses, thus allowing the safe administration of spinal or epidural anesthesia. 123,124 Regardless of the pharmacological prophylaxis and the chosen mode of delivery, pregnant women should wear elastic compression stockings throughout the procedure. 4 Although the risk associated with cesarean delivery alone is low, the incidence of VTE increases in the presence of other associated risk factors. Therefore, thromboprophylaxis should be prescribed based on the risk stratification of each pregnant woman, with a validated risk assessment model. 123,124 VTE and contraception In Brazil, 1 in every 5 women uses oral contraceptives (OCs), which offer benefits beyond contraception, such as reduced menstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea, premenstrual syndrome, migraines, acne, and hirsutism. OCs also have long-term benefits, such as reduced incidence of endometrial, ovarian, and colorectal cancer. 122 OCs increase the risk of VTE from an initial rate of 5 per 10,000 woman-years among nonusers to 9-10 per 10,000 woman-years among users. To keep this risk in perspective, it is important to note that the risk of VTE is 29 per 10,000 women during pregnancy and 300-400 per 10,000 women during puerperium. 122 The thromboembolic risk of OCs is related to the dose of estrogen and the type of progestin combined with it. Older OCs with high estrogen levels (> 50 μg ethinyl estradiol) are associated with a higher risk of VTE than newer OCs (< 50 μg ethinyl estradiol). However, no risk reduction was confirmed with OCs containing 20 μg of ethinyl estradiol compared with those containing 30 μg of ethinyl estradiol. 12 2 The type of progestin also influences the risk of VTE, where second-generation progestins (levonorgestrel [LNG] and norethisterone) are safer than third- and fourth- generation progestins. 122 The OC-related risk of VTE is associated with increasing body weight and age and with the reintroduction or change of OC after discontinuation exceeding 4 weeks. Among OC users, those with inherited thrombophilia are at increased risk of developing VTE. However, given the low prevalence of inherited thrombophilia in the general population and the high cost of diagnostic laboratory screening, routine screening is not recommended. 12 2 Personal or family history of VTE is the most important and most common risk factor for OC-associated VTE. 12 2 Non-oral contraceptives, including transdermal patches and vaginal rings, are also associated with an increased risk of VTE, increasing the risk by 7.9 and 6.5 times, respectively. 12 2 Coagulation does not show significant changes with the use of progesterone-only OCs, LNG-containing implants, LNG-releasing intrauterine system, or depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injection. Therefore, it can be safely used in this scenario. 122 TEV and assisted reproduction In vitro fertilization (IVF) is the most widely used technique for human reproduction in infertile couples, and VTE is a rare complication of this technique, occurring in only 0.1% to 2.4% of fertilization cycles. 12 2 The risk of VTE doubles in pregnancies after IVF compared with the baseline risk of pregnant women not undergoing IVF. This is particularly due to the 5- to 10-fold increase in risk during the first trimester of pregnancies after IVF, secondary to ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), an iatrogenic and potentially fatal complication that occurs in 33% of all IVF cycles. Women who develop OHSS have a 100 times higher risk of VTE and, in severe OHSS, thromboprophylaxis with LMWH reduces the incidence of VTE without significantly increasing bleeding. 122",
    "Deep vein thrombosis: diagnosis and treatment 13/27 Sobreira et al. J Vasc Bras. 2024;23:e20230107. https://doi.org/10.1590/1677-5449.202301072 IVF-related VTE occurs most frequently between days 40 and 42 after embryo transfer and tends to be located in the upper extremities and cervical region rather than in the left lower extremity, the most common site in spontaneous pregnancies. 12 2 IVF also increases the risk of arterial thrombosis, which occurs on average on day 10 after embryo transfer. 122 VTE and HRT Although recent data show that the risks of HRT may outweigh its benefits, many women still receive HRT with estrogens, indiscriminately, to minimize menopausal symptoms. This approach is associated with an increased incidence of VTE, especially in the first year of treatment. Additionally, women with a uterus also receive progestins to counteract the risk of endometrial cancer on HRT, which may be an additional risk factor for developing VTE. 122 Observational studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses consistently report a 2- to 3-fold higher risk of VTE in postmenopausal women on HRT than in postmenopausal women not on HRT. 122 The risk of VTE in women receiving HRT depends on the route of administration. Oral estrogens cause procoagulant changes, such as increased resistance to activated protein C, by reducing serum protein S levels and fibrinolytic activity, probably because they pass through and are metabolized in the liver; however, these changes are not observed in HRT via the transdermal route. There are no adequate data on the use of transdermal estrogen in pregnant and breastfeeding women. 122 To prevent VTE in women who will receive HRT, it is important to identify those most susceptible. Those with a personal or family history of VTE are considered to be at high risk and, therefore, are not candidates for HRT with oral estrogens. 122 HRT is, in fact, the most effective treatment to minimize menopausal symptoms associated with a drop in estrogen levels during menopause. However, it should not be prescribed indiscriminately. After evaluation of the risks and benefits, the best strategy to protect against the risk of VTE is to prescribe HRT with the lowest transdermal estrogen dose possible, alone or combined with micronized progestins, for the shortest duration possible. 123 VTE in transgender women The terms transgender and gender nonconformity describe a situation in which a person’s gender identity differs from the external sexual anatomy they were born with. The goals of gender affirmation in transgender women are to suppress masculine characteristics and induce feminine characteristics to the extent possible. The provision of physician-guided gender-affirming HT and surgery supported by the health system has improved quality of life and reduced disorders observed in this population, including VTE. 124 Several studies have demonstrated an increased risk of VTE in transgender women receiving HT, and this risk is related to the type and dose of the hormones used and, mainly, to their route of administration. Transdermal is the preferred route of administration in transgender women with a personal or family history of VTE and in those with inherited thrombophilia. 12 4 It is worth noting that, for this population, HT is not an elective therapy, but rather an absolute necessity to achieve the desired phenotype. In many places, transgender women live on the fringes of society, without access to health professionals or services qualified to prescribe HT. As a consequence, HT is often obtained illegally and taken on one’s own, without professional guidance on safe composition, doses, and routes. Another point to ponder is that non-oral routes of HT administration are usually more expensive than the oral route, thus becoming inaccessible for most patients. 124 A plausible strategy to mitigate the risk of VTE in at-risk groups is the concomitant initiation of prophylactic anticoagulation with HT, especially for the first 6 to 12 months of treatment. 12 4 Adequate prescriptions for contraception and HRT also require maturity and medical knowledge. Simply prohibiting the use of OCs and HRT without carefully assessing each patient’s risk factors and personal or family history does not have a decisive impact on the occurrence of VTE and unnecessarily exposes women to the risk of an unwanted pregnancy and/or a decline in quality of life in any age group. Extended anticoagulation – secondary prophylaxis Secondary VTE prophylaxis, also called “extended therapy,” consists of maintaining antithrombotic therapy (anticoagulants or, less frequently, antiplatelet agents) after the initial period of acute VTE treatment (3 to 6 months), with the purpose of preventing recurrence. The incidence of a new VTE event after initial treatment can exceed 40% within 10 years. 12 5 However, it is possible to identify individuals at higher risk of recurrence and then target extended anticoagulation to patients who will benefit from such a strategy. Two elementary factors should be considered in the decision-making process to indicate secondary VTE prophylaxis: the risk of VTE recurrence and the risk of bleeding in patients receiving anticoagulation. Therefore, the risk of VTE recurrence should be estimated considering the factors that characterize",
    "Deep vein thrombosis: diagnosis and treatment 14/27 Sobreira et al. J Vasc Bras. 2024;23:e20230107. https://doi.org/10.1590/1677-5449.202301072 low, intermediate, and high risk, as detailed in Table 1 . Patients at low risk of recurrence have no indication for extended secondary prophylaxis. 104,12 6 Conversely, patients with recurrent VTE without identifiable risk factors or with persistent risk factors usually benefit from extended therapy. 10 3 Finally, patients at intermediate risk of VTE often benefit from secondary prophylaxis as long as they have a low risk of bleeding. 105-107 Major transient risk factors reduce the likelihood of recurrence, as VTE only occurs in the presence of a strong thrombotic stimulus. The occurrence of VTE in the presence of minor risk factors is associated with an increased risk of recurrence. The rationale behind this evidence is the fact that patients who developed VTE even in the presence of weak stimuli are more prone to recurrence, 10 5 as shown in Table 9 . Secondary prophylaxis with ASA or low-dose warfarin (target INR between 1.5 and 2.0) did not demonstrate a good efficacy and safety relationship in preventing VTE recurrence. 128-130 More recently, with the advent of DOACs and their superiority in safety outcomes, 108-11 1 new investigations were conducted, validating their use in the initial and extended treatment of VTE. These studies are shown in Table 10 . In phase IV studies, DOACs have demonstrated efficacy and safety results comparable to those obtained in phase III randomized clinical trials. 131-141 Dabigatran was superior to placebo and noninferior to warfarin in reducing recurrent VTE.

Compared with warfarin, dabigatran was superior in reducing clinically relevant bleeding events and noninferior in the incidence of major bleeding. 108 The efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban were tested in two separate investigations. 1,28,11 0 In the first, rivaroxaban at a therapeutic dose (20 mg/ day) demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo, but with more bleeding events (no difference in major bleeding). A second three-group study compared two different doses of rivaroxaban (10 and 20 mg/day) vs ASA 100 mg/day. Both doses of rivaroxaban showed similar efficacy in preventing VTE recurrence, and both were superior to ASA. There was no difference in bleeding between the groups. A study was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of apixaban in reducing recurrent VTE. Two doses of apixaban (2.5 mg and 5.0 mg every 12 hours) were compared with placebo, both showing superiority in efficacy and noninferiority in safety. 11 1 It is important to note that patients at high risk of bleeding were systematically excluded from the aforementioned studies. Dose and choice of antithrombotic agent Although warfarin and ASA have been superior to placebo in preventing recurrent VTE, subsequent studies have demonstrated the superiority of DOACs for this purpose. Therefore, VKAs and ASA should be used for this purpose only in situations where DOACs are contraindicated, such as in APS. 11 2 In the only comparative study between warfarin and rivaroxaban in patients with triple-positive APS, warfarin demonstrated superiority in the composite outcome of efficacy and safety, being the drug of choice for this group of patients. 11 3 However, it remains unclear whether all patients should receive reduced doses. In patients at high risk of recurrence and low risk of bleeding, the use of full-dose DOACs appears to be the appropriate choice. Duration of extended VTE treatment There is no rigid definition of the optimal duration of extended VTE treatment. Most clinical trials investigating this strategy reported a duration of 1 to 2 years, with few exceeding 36 months. However, for patients with recurrent VTE with no identifiable or persistent risk factors, indefinite anticoagulation is recommended. 10 3 The term “life-long anticoagulation” should be avoided, since the maintenance of anticoagulant therapy should be regularly reassessed, considering the balance between the risk of VTE recurrence and the risk of bleeding. Interventional treatment of acute VTE IVC filter The use of IVC filters has been associated with numerous controversies in recent years. There are reports of excessive use for questionable indications and failure to retrieve the devices, which were designed to be temporary, with subsequent thrombotic complications. It should be noted that the sole purpose of IVC filters is to prevent PE and, therefore, reduce its morbidity and mortality. However, IVC filters are the only viable treatment option for patients with DVT with contraindication to anticoagulation, although randomized trials are needed. In the Prévention du Risque d’Embolie Pulmonaire par Interruption Cave (PREPIC) study, 14 2 400 patients with proximal DVT, with or without concomitant symptomatic PE, were randomized to receive a permanent IVC filter or no filter. The study used a two-by-two factorial design, and patients were also randomized to SC LMWH (enoxaparin) or IV UFH (aiming at an aPTT ratio of 1.5 and 2.5). All patients underwent baseline and follow-up perfusion/ventilation lung scanning when symptoms of potential PE occurred, or between 8 and 12 days to assess for asymptomatic PE. The primary outcome was the occurrence of PE (symptomatic or asymptomatic) within 12 days of randomization. A number of symptom-based secondary outcomes were also assessed. On day 12, symptomatic or asymptomatic PE occurred in only 2 patients (1.1%) in the filter group vs 9 patients (4.8%) in the no-filter group. At 2 years, 6 PE events occurred in the filter group (1 death) and 12 in the no-filter group (5 deaths; OR 0.5; 95% CI, 0.19-1.33; p=0.16), but recurrent DVT occurred in 37 patients (20.8%) in the filter group vs 21 patients (11.6%) in the no-filter group (OR 1.87; 95% CI, 1.1-3.2; p=0.02). Mortality rates were similar in both groups at 2 years (43 patients in the filter group vs 40 patients in the no-filter group). The 8-year results were published in 2005 and showed that symptomatic PE occurred in 9 patients (6%) in the filter group vs 24 (15%) in the no-filter group (p=0.008). However, recurrent DVT was more common in the filter group (57 patients vs 41 patients; p=0.042). Despite the reduced risk of PE, the authors concluded, based on the increased risk of recurrent DVT and lack of survival benefit, that the systematic use of IVC filters cannot be recommended for this population. In the prospective, randomized PREPIC 2 study, 14 3 published in 2015, 399 patients with symptomatic PE and DVT were analyzed. Patients with at least one criterion for severity, ie, age > 75 years, active cancer, chronic cardiac or respiratory failure, ischemic stroke",

Patients in both groups, with and without IVC filter, received anticoagulation for 6 months, and filter retrieval was planned at 3 months from placement. The filter was successfully inserted in 193 patients and was retrieved as planned in 153 of the 164 patients in whom retrieval was attempted. At 3 months, recurrent PE occurred in 6 patients (3.0%; all fatal) in the filter group and in 3 patients (1.5%; 2 fatal) in the control group (RR with filter, 2.00; 95% CI, 0.51-7.89; p=0.50). Results were similar at 6 months. No difference was observed between the 2 groups regarding the other outcomes. Filter thrombosis occurred in 3 patients. The authors concluded that, among hospitalized patients with severe acute PE, the use of a retrievable IVC filter plus anticoagulation, compared with anticoagulation alone, did not reduce the risk of symptomatic recurrent PE at 3 months. These findings do not support the use of this type of filter in patients who can be treated with anticoagulation. In the Filter Implantation to Lower Thromboembolic Risk in Percutaneous Endovenous Intervention (FILTER-PEVI) study, 14 4 141 patients undergoing early thrombus removal were randomized to receive an IVC filter or no filter. Patients with and without PE at presentation were included. Only symptomatic patients were investigated, and PE was identified in 1 patient in the filter group and in 8 in the no-filter group. However, there was no difference in mortality between the groups, and the study was weakened by the lack of preoperative imaging of the pulmonary arteries. Absolute contraindication to anticoagulation includes uncontrollable active bleeding, high risk of major bleeding (eg, coagulation defect, severe thrombocytopenia, recent intracerebral hemorrhage, or brain injury at high risk of bleeding), or urgent surgery requiring discontinuation of anticoagulation. 145 There appears to be a consensus with good quality evidence that anticoagulation should not be used concomitantly with IVC filter implantation, nor in cases of temporary contraindication to anticoagulation; in patients with an already implanted filter, anticoagulation should be resumed as soon as the risk of bleeding is resolved. 11,54,84,146 Recommendation 15 In patients with acute PE, receiving anticoagulation, we recommend against IVC filter insertion. Class II, level B 143-145 Recommendation 16 In patients with proximal DVT and a formal contraindication to starting anticoagulation, or up to the first 3 months of treatment, we recommend the insertion of a temporary IVC filter. Class II, level B. 143-145 Recommendation 17 In patients with acute PE and an IVC filter inserted as an alternative to anticoagulation, we recommend conventional anticoagulant therapy if the risk of bleeding has been resolved. Class II, level B. 143-145 Interventional treatment of acute VTE – thrombolysis, pharmacomechanical thrombectomy (PMT) There are many published studies on the interventional treatment of acute VTE, but only 4 prospective randomized studies have sufficient power to analyze the results: CaVenT, ATTRACT, ATTRACT (phase III), and CAVA. 147-153 The CaVenT study compared adjunctive catheter- directed thrombolysis (CDT) with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in addition to anticoagulation alone followed by continued oral anticoagulants in 2 groups for at least 6 months. The primary efficacy outcome was the presence of PTS, defined as a score ≥ 5 on the Villalta scale in the affected extremity or presence of an ulcer in the leg at the 24-month visit. The study showed a significant reduction in PTS in the intervention group, with an absolute risk reduction of 14.4% at 24 months. 147-14 9 Long-term follow-up results from the CaVenT study showed that the absolute risk reduction increased to 28% after 5 years. The number needed to treat decreased from 7 to 4, 14 7 and no difference was detected in quality of life, but the study did not consider this outcome. Quality of life worsened significantly in patients who developed PTS across the entire study population. 14 8 Furthermore, a cost- effectiveness analysis demonstrated a net benefit of treatment, with an increase in the cost-effectiveness ratio of US$20,000 per quality-adjusted life years. 150 The ATTRACT trial was a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial that evaluated PMT and CDT for the prevention of PTS in patients with femoral or more proximal DVT compared with standard therapy with oral anticoagulants alone. 15 1 The protocol consisted of 3 different modalities (CDT alone or combined with PMT using Angiojet®/Trellis-8®) in patients randomized to the treatment group, at the discretion of the treating physician. The primary efficacy outcome was similar to that of the CaVenT study, that is, the",

J Vasc Bras. 2024;23:e20230107. https://doi.org/10.1590/1677-5449.202301072 presence of PTS, defined as a Villalta score ≥ 5 in the affected extremity or an ulcer, occurring at any time between the post-randomization 6-month follow-up visit and the 24-month follow-up visit (included). Over 24 months, there was no significant between- group difference in the percentage of patients who developed PTS (47% with CDT/PMT vs 48% with standard therapy; RR 0.96; 95% CI, 0.82-1.11; p=0.56). PMT led to more major bleeding events at 10 days (1.7% PMT vs 0.3% standard therapy; p=0.049), but no significant difference in recurrent VTE was observed at 24 months (12.5% PMT vs 8.5% standard therapy; p=0.087). The intervention reduced leg pain and edema at 30 days but did not significantly improve quality of life from baseline to 24 months of treatment. The intervention significantly reduced both PTS severity scores and the development of moderate-to-severe PTS (18% with PMT vs 24% with standard therapy; RR 0.73; 95% CI, 0.54-0.98; 0.04) over the 24-months period. The ATTRACT (Phase III) trial 15 2 was a phase III, multicenter, open-label, assessor-blind, randomized clinical trial. Angiojet® was used for PMT and, in cases where the thrombus extended more distal to the popliteal vein, CDT could be performed prior to PMT. In femoropopliteal DVT, except for reduced PTS at 6 months of follow-up (21.7% with PMT vs 40.8% with control; p=0.01), no significant differences were identified in early or late study outcomes between the PMT and control-arm patients. In iliofemoral DVT, PTS developed in 41 (43.2%) of 95 patients treated with PMT and 40 (40.0%) of 100 control-arm patients (p=0.65) at 24 months. The point estimates of the Villalta scale and venous clinical severity scale scores from 6 to 24 months and of the proportions of patients with PTS at 6 months (26.2% vs 39.2%; p=0.08) were nominally lower for PMT than for control, but the differences were not statistically significant, nor were the differences observed in the 2-year occurrences of moderate-to- severe PTS, severe PTS, venous ulceration, or quality of life from 6 to 24 months. Improvement in early disease severity was greater for PMT than for control, reaching statistical significance at 30 days (mean difference of 0.84 Likert scale points; p=0.0061). From baseline to 30 days, patients treated with PMT had greater improvement in quality of life (difference of 12.6 VEINES-QOL scale points; p=0.0001) and symptoms (difference of 11.4 VEINES-Sym scale points; p=0.0003) than the control-arm patients. At 30 days, those treated with PMT also had less residual thrombus. Regarding complications, major bleeding, PE, renal failure, and bradycardia were infrequent with PMT (< 2% each), but 24-month VTE recurrence was more frequent (13.9% with PMT vs 6.8% with control; p=0.03). The CAVA trial was a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial that compared the use of ultrasound- accelerated thrombolysis with standard anticoagulation alone. 15 3 In contrast to the ATTRACT trial, the CAVA trial involved only iliofemoral DVT, thus addressing one of the criticisms raised about the inclusion criteria of the ATTRACT trial. Overall, the CAVA trial randomized 184 patients: 91 to intervention and 93 to standard therapy, with 77 receiving the intervention and 75 remaining in the standard therapy group after screening failure/withdrawal of consent. After 12 months of follow-up, the trial showed no between- group differences, with 22 (29%) of 77 patients who received the intervention vs 26 (35%) of 75 patients who received standard therapy developing PTS (p=0.42). These data led to the conclusion that, for patients with acute proximal DVT, PMT did not prevent PTS but increased major bleeding. The results suggested that there may be a benefit in reducing the risk of moderate-to-severe PTS, despite the higher- than-expected rate of PTS in patients treated with early thrombus removal. 15 3 However, no benefit was observed in patients with femoropopliteal DVT. 154 In a Cochrane systematic review, 15 5 comparing thrombolysis strategy with anticoagulation for lower extremity DVT, patients who received thrombolysis had more bleeding episodes (6.7% vs 2.2%) (RR 2.45; 95% CI, 1.58-3.78; 1943 participants, 19 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). No differences between strategies were detected by subgroup analysis (p=0.25). Up to 5 years after treatment, slightly fewer cases of PTS occurred in those receiving thrombolysis, 50% vs 53% with standard anticoagulation (RR 0.78; 95% CI, 0.66-0.93; 1393 participants, 6 studies; moderate- certainty evidence). This was still observed at late follow-up (beyond 5 years) in 2 studies (RR 0.56; 95% CI, 0.43-0.73; 211 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Using subgroup analysis to investigate if the level of DVT (iliofemoral, femoropopliteal, or non-specified) had an effect on the incidence of PTS, no benefit of thrombolysis was observed regardless of the level of DVT (6 studies; test for subgroup differences: p=0.29). Systemic thrombolysis and CDT had similar levels of effectiveness. Studies of CDT included 4 trials in femoral and iliofemoral DVT, and the results are consistent with those from trials of systemic thrombolysis in DVT at other levels of occlusion.

Class II, level C 147-153 Recommendation 20 In patients with acute lower extremity DVT who have undergone thrombus removal, anticoagulation should have the same intensity and duration as that indicated for patients who have not undergone a thrombus removal procedure. Class I, level B 147-153 COVID-19 AND VTE COVID-19-related VTE Epidemiology An increased risk of thromboembolic events in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 has been demonstrated by several studies, 156-16 0 as well as higher mortality when these events are associated, making it necessary to suspect them especially in patients with moderate-to-severe infection admitted to wards or intensive care units (ICUs). Thrombotic events in the venous system and their consequences, which include DVT and PE, are generally more common in hospitalized patients, especially in ICUs, 16 1 with an incidence of VTE in hospitalized patients without thromboprophylaxis of 14.9%. 161,162 According to a meta-analysis published in the Chest Journal in 2021, in patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization, the rate of VTE was 17%, PE was 7.1%, and DVT was 12.1%. 16 3 In another recent meta- analysis, the prevalence of DVT and PE in hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 was even higher (14.8% and 16.5%, respectively). 164 Diagnosis Laboratory testing DD levels are elevated in most patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection even without VTE, but some studies have shown even higher DD levels in patients with COVID-19 associated with DVT and PE. 165-167 Demelo-Rodríguez et al. 16 7 reported that a DD cutoff point of 1.57 (μg/mL) has a sensitivity of 95.7%, specificity of 29.3%, positive predictive value of 19%, and negative predictive value of 97.5% for the diagnosis of asymptomatic DVT in patients with COVID-19. Elevated DD was also considered as a predictor of severity. 168,169 Treatment The principles of VTE treatment in patients with COVID-19 do not differ from those in patients with non-COVID-19 VTE. 17 0 The use of parenteral anticoagulants is recommended as initial therapy (UFH and LMWH), especially in hospitalized patients, with the possibility of transitioning to oral anticoagulants (DOACs or VKAs) after clinical stabilization. 17 1 DOACs have been the therapy of choice in the transition from parenteral to oral regimens because they have lower bleeding rates than warfarin. Factor Xa inhibitors, such as rivaroxaban and apixaban, have been the most widely used to treat VTE in patients with COVID-19 after hospital discharge and stabilization of the patient’s clinical condition. Treatment duration will depend on whether or not risk factors persist, in addition to concomitant diseases that require full-dose anticoagulation, but it should be considered for at least 3 months. 172 Anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19 without evidence of VTE This topic has raised many questions and discrepant studies in the literature. There is no doubt that patients with COVID-19 with evidence of VTE should receive a standard therapeutic anticoagulation regimen, and the same should be administered to patients without COVID-19. The crux of the issue is what type of anticoagulant regimen should be administered to patients with COVID-19 without evidence of thrombotic events. Two studies have recently evaluated therapeutic-dose and prophylactic-dose anticoagulation regimens in 2 types of patients: critically ill patients requiring orotracheal intubation, and hospitalized patients with moderate COVID-19 not requiring supplemental oxygen therapy. The first study evaluated the types of anticoagulation in critically ill patients, already on orotracheal intubation, admitted to the ICU. A total of 1098 patients were evaluated: one group of patients receiving UFH or enoxaparin at a therapeutic dose, and the other group of patients receiving enoxaparin or UFH at a prophylactic dose. The results of the study showed that survival to hospital discharge was 62.7% in patients on a therapeutic-dose regimen vs 64.5% in patients on a prophylactic-dose regimen, with no statistical difference between the groups. The rate of major bleeding, however, was higher with therapeutic-dose anticoagulation than with prophylactic-dose anticoagulation (3.8% vs 2.3%). The authors concluded that there was no difference in mortality between critically ill patients receiving therapeutic-dose and prophylactic-dose anticoagulation, but there was a higher rate of bleeding among patients receiving full-dose anticoagulation. 17 3 The",

J Vasc Bras. 2024;23:e20230107. https://doi.org/10.1590/1677-5449.202301072 INSPIRATION study, which evaluated 600 patients admitted to the ICU, randomized to treatment with full-dose vs prophylactic-dose anticoagulation, found no benefit with therapeutic-dose anticoagulation in preventing mortality, thromboembolic events, or need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (HR 1.06; 95% CI, 0.83-1.36). 174 Another study aimed to evaluate therapeutic-dose vs prophylactic-dose anticoagulation with enoxaparin or UFH in hospitalized patients with moderate COVID-19, without target organ damage or failure and no need for supplemental oxygen therapy. Among 2219 patients in the final analysis, the probability that therapeutic-dose anticoagulation increased organ support-free days, as compared with usual-care thromboprophylaxis, was 98.6%. The final probability of the superiority of therapeutic-dose anticoagulation over usual-care thromboprophylaxis was 97.3% in patients with high DD levels, 92.9% in patients with low DD levels, and 97.3% in patients with unknown DD levels. Major bleeding occurred in 1.9% of patients receiving therapeutic-dose anticoagulation and in 0.9% of those receiving thromboprophylaxis. The authors concluded that full-dose anticoagulation with enoxaparin or UFH in patients with moderate COVID-19 increased the probability of survival to hospital discharge with a lower incidence of multisystem organ failure, that is, renal, cardiovascular, and respiratory failure. 172,173 Likewise, the HEP-COVID trial evaluated 253 patients with COVID-19 and elevated DD levels, randomized to therapeutic-dose or prophylactic-dose anticoagulants. The primary outcomes (death, VTE, and arterial thrombosis) were higher in the group receiving prophylactic-dose anticoagulation (42%) than in the group receiving full-dose anticoagulation (29%) (RR 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.96; p=0.03). 17 5 This benefit was only observed in patients on medical wards. Patients admitted to the ICU did not benefit from full-dose anticoagulation. Overall, based on the literature, in critically ill patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19, the use of prophylactic-dose anticoagulation is recommended (SC enoxaparin 40 mg once daily). For hospitalized patients with COVID-19 on medical wards, therapeutic- dose anticoagulation is recommended (SC rivaroxaban 20 mg/day or SC enoxaparin 1 mg/kg/dose, every 12 hours). In turn, patients hospitalized for other clinical conditions, in whom COVID-19 is discovered incidentally, prophylactic-dose anticoagulation is sufficient, being recommended in the general literature. A potential benefit of maintaining anticoagulation at prophylactic doses after hospital discharge of patients with COVID-19, at high risk of VTE, was demonstrated in the MICHELLE study, 17 6 which evaluated 320 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at high risk of developing VTE but with no documented evidence of VTE at the time of discharge, randomized to receive rivaroxaban 10 mg or no anticoagulation for 35 days after hospital discharge. The incidence of complications (VTE, arterial thromboembolism, or cardiovascular events) was higher in patients receiving no anticoagulation (9%) than in those receiving prophylactic-dose rivaroxaban (3%) (RR 0.33; 95% CI, 0.12-0.90). Despite the robust data, this is a small cohort. Therefore, there is still no consensus in the literature on the routine recommendation of prophylactic- dose anticoagulation for patients at high risk of VTE discharged after hospitalization for COVID-19, and a case-by-case analysis is recommended, weighing the risks and benefits for each patient, pending new studies in the literature. Another study, which followed 4906 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who were discharged to outpatient care, showed an incidence of VTE of 1.6% post-discharge, with pharmacological prophylaxis for VTE being used only in 13% of the sample. The incidence of VTE was lower in patients not receiving anticoagulants than in those receiving pharmacological prophylaxis for VTE in this study sample. The rate of major bleeding with anticoagulation was 1.7%, higher than the risk of VTE. 177 Most patients with COVID-19 are treated on an outpatient basis, not requiring hospital admission. Pharmacological prophylaxis for VTE is not indicated for these patients unless they have other associated factors that require anticoagulant use, including current documented VTE, atrial fibrillation, active cancer, and inherited thrombophilia posing a high risk of VTE, such as antithrombin deficiency and protein C deficiency, among others. Each patient should be evaluated individually, weighing the risks and benefits of using anticoagulants as pharmacological prophylaxis for VTE in patients with COVID-19 treated on an outpatient basis not requiring hospitalization. In summary, VTE treatment in patients with COVID-19 follows principles similar to those of treatment of VTE unrelated to COVID-19. The use of parenteral anticoagulants is recommended as initial therapy (UFH and LMWH) in hospitalized patients, with the possibility of transitioning to oral anticoagulants (DOACs or VKAs) after clinical stabilization. DOACs, such as rivaroxaban and apixaban, are preferred due to reduced bleeding rates compared with warfarin. Therefore, the decision to use post-discharge VTE pharmacological prophylaxis should be personalized, considering the risk-benefit ratio. In outpatients, prophylaxis is not systematically recommended, except in the presence of risk factors and taking into",

    "Trombose venosa profunda: diagnóstico e tratamento 2/27 Sobreira et al. J Vasc Bras. 2024;23:e20230107. https://doi.org/10.1590/1677-5449.202301071 INTRODUÇÃO A trombose venosa profunda (TVP) caracteriza-se pela formação de trombos dentro de veias profundas, com obstrução parcial ou oclusão, sendo mais comum nos membros inferiores – em 80-95% dos casos 1,2 . As principais complicações decorrentes dessa doença são insuficiência venosa crônica/síndrome pós-trombótica (SPT) (edema e/ou dor em membros inferiores, mudança na pigmentação, ulcerações na pele) e embolia pulmonar (EP). Esta última tem alta importância clínica, por apresentar alto índice de mortalidade 1,2 . Aproximadamente 5 a 15% de indivíduos não tratados da TVP podem morrer de EP 3 . TVP ou EP podem ocorrer em 2/1.000 indivíduos a cada ano, com uma taxa de recorrência de até 25% 3 . A rápida adoção de estratégias diagnósticas e terapêuticas é crucial para evitar essas complicações. FATORES DE RISCO Os principais fatores diretamente ligados à gênese dos trombos são estase sanguínea, lesão endotelial e estados de hipercoagulabilidade 2 . Portanto, idade avançada, câncer, procedimentos cirúrgicos, imobilização, uso de estrogênio, ciclo gravídico-puerperal, distúrbios de hipercoagulabilidade hereditários ou adquiridos, constituem-se como fatores de risco para TVP 3,4 . A sua incidência aumenta proporcionalmente com a idade, sugerindo que esse seja o fator de risco mais determinante para um primeiro evento trombótico 5 . Para efeitos didáticos, os fatores de risco podem ser classificados como 6 : - Hereditários/idiopáticos: resistência à proteína C ativada (principalmente fator V Leiden); mutação do gene da protrombina G20210A; deficiência de antitrombina; deficiência de proteína C; deficiência de proteína S; aumento do fator VIII; aumento do fibrinogênio; - Adquiridos/provocados: síndrome do anticorpo antifosfolipídio (SAF); câncer; hemoglobinúria paroxística noturna; idade > 65 anos; sobrepeso e obesidade; gravidez e puerpério; doenças mieloproliferativas (policitemia vera; trombocitemia essencial etc.); síndrome nefrótica; hiperviscosidade (macroglobulinemia de Waldenström; mieloma múltiplo); doença de Behçet; trauma; cirurgias; imobilização; terapia estrogênica. CLASSIFICAÇÃO A TVP nos membros inferiores é dividida, segundo sua localização: - Proximal: quando acomete veia ilíaca e/ou femoral e/ou poplítea; - Distal: quando acomete as veias localizadas abaixo da veia poplítea. O risco de EP e a magnitude da SPT decorrente da TVP proximal são maiores. Entretanto, existe risco de progressão da TVP distal para segmentos proximais de até 20%, o que faz com que o seu diagnóstico e tratamento sejam similares ao da TVP proximal 7 . Portanto, a classificação do tipo de TVP suspeita é importante para guiar as estratégias de tratamento. DIAGNÓSTICO Exame físico Os principais sinais e sintomas, quando presentes, são: dor, edema, eritema, cianose, dilatação do sistema venoso superficial, aumento de temperatura e empastamento muscular 7 . Os principais fatores relacionados ao surgimento da TVP, associados ao quadro de dor e edema, podem ser agrupados em modelos de predição clínica 8 . Nenhuma avaliação clínica feita de forma isolada é suficiente para diagnosticar ou descartar a TVP 1 , pois os achados clínicos se relacionam com a doença em apenas 50% dos casos 2 . A literatura existente recomenda a anamnese e o exame físico, combinados com a realização de testes laboratoriais e exames de imagem 1,8,9 . O sistema de predição clínica de TVP mais bem estudado é o escore de Wells (EW) 9,10 . Escore de Wells (EW) É um modelo de predição clínica, baseado em sinais e sintomas, fatores de risco e diagnósticos alternativos, estimando a probabilidade pré-teste para TVP ( Tabela 1 ). Esse escore tem se mostrado útil na abordagem inicial do paciente com suspeita de TVP 8,9,12 . Em sua primeira versão, categoriza os pacientes com probabilidade baixa, moderada ou alta de TVP, com uma prevalência de 5% (IC95% 4-8), 17% (IC95% 13-23) e 53% (IC95% 44-61), respectivamente 10 . O EW deve ser usado em combinação com métodos diagnósticos adicionais, como o eco-Doppler colorido (EDC) associado à compressão de todo trajeto venoso troncular do membro inferior (pacientes com EW de alta probabilidade) e a mensuração do D-dímero (DD) (pacientes com EW de baixa probabilidade) 1,9 . A combinação EDC negativa seguida de DD negativo permite descartar com segurança a hipótese da TVP 8 . Metanálise elaborada por Geersing et al. 8 define que, com EW ≤1 e DD negativo, a probabilidade de TVP é menor que 2%, podendo ser excluída com segurança em diferentes grupos de pacientes, com exceção da presença de câncer e TVP recorrente.",
    "Trombose venosa profunda: diagnóstico e tratamento 3/27 Sobreira et al. J Vasc Bras. 2024;23:e20230107. https://doi.org/10.1590/1677-5449.202301071 O EW apresenta melhor resultado na avaliação de pacientes jovens sem comorbidades ou história prévia de tromboembolismo venoso (TEV) do que em outros pacientes 13 . Para TVP recorrente é recomendado usar o EW modificado (que inclui pontuação extra para a história prévia de TVP) 8 . Exame laboratorial DD no diagnóstico e acompanhamento do TEV O DD é um marcador molecular que resulta da dissolução da fibrina. Costuma estar elevado em eventos trombóticos, mas também pode estar elevado em outras situações, como gestação, câncer, trauma, infecção e outros processos pró-inflamatórios 1 . A sensibilidade desse marcador varia de 94 a 100%, de modo que a ausência de elevação sérica de DD afasta um diagnóstico de TVP em 97 a 98% dos casos. Seus valores situam-se em grupos: negativo (<350 ng/mL), intermediário (351-500 ng/mL) e positivo (>500 ng/mL) 13,14 . Quanto mais avançada a idade do paciente, maior o valor do DD, o que diminui e especificidade do teste. Uma revisão sistemática publicada em 2014 demonstrou a necessidade de se ajustar o valor referência do DD com a idade (idade multiplicada por 10 mcg/L) em pacientes mais velhos que 50 anos, e isso aumentou a especificidade sem alterar a sensibilidade do teste laboratorial 14 . A gestação também aumenta o valor do DD, o que pode reduzir a especificidade do teste, caso seja necessária sua avaliação em um eventual diagnóstico de TVP 14,15 . Em um pequeno estudo com mulheres assintomáticas, nenhuma das gestantes apresentava um valor de DD menor 0,50 mg/L no terceiro trimestre. Os autores concluíram que um valor maior deveria ser usado com referência no primeiro trimestre (0,75 mg/L), no segundo trimestre (1 mg/L) e no terceiro trimestre (1,5 mg/L) 16 . Recomendação 1 Quando combinado com um resultado negativo no teste DD, é possível excluir a TVP em pacientes que apresentam uma pontuação de baixa probabilidade no EW. Classe I, nível A9 DD e o risco de TEV Em pacientes internados com doenças críticas, a elevação do DD está associada a um risco aumentado de TEV, independentemente da idade, sexo, raça, índice de massa corpórea e doença clínica 17 . O estudo Magellan avaliou 7.581 pacientes hospitalizados com doenças críticas e observou que a incidência de TEV foi 3,5 vezes maior entre os pacientes com concentração sérica de DD maior ou igual a duas vezes o valor normal (OR 2,29; IC95% 1,75-2,98) 17 . Na população em geral, um DD elevado esteve associado a maior risco de um primeiro episódio de TEV, em um estudo que avaliou 923 pacientes durante 8 anos 18 . Entre portadores de câncer, os níveis de DD são consideravelmente elevados nos pacientes que apresentam o primeiro episódio de TEV 19 . Em um estudo que avaliou 821 pacientes com câncer e concentração de DD duas vezes maior que o valor normal, a incidência de TEV foi 1,3 vezes tanto em uma análise univariada (IC95% 1,1-1.5; p < 0.001) quanto multivariada (HR 1,3; IC95% 1,2-1,6; p < 0.001) 20 . A associação entre níveis elevados de DD e a ocorrência do primeiro episódio de TEV foi validada em vários estudos, incluindo câncer colorretal, pulmão e câncer ginecológico 21 . DD e recorrência de TEV Em relação à recorrência de TEV e o valor do DD, há uma emblemática revisão sistemática na literatura, envolvendo 1.888 pacientes com um primeiro episódio de TEV não provocada, que demonstrou que os pacientes que mantinham níveis de DD elevados após a descontinuação da terapia anticoagulante apresentaram incidência anual de TEV de 8,9%, comparada com a incidência de 3,5% de TEV em pacientes com níveis normais de DD 22 . Outra metanálise realizada com a mesma população demonstrou incidência anual de TEV recorrente de 8,8% em pacientes com níveis elevados de DD, contra 3,7% em pacientes com níveis normais de DD 23 . Estudo publicado recentemente demonstrou uma associação entre níveis elevados de DD com o risco de recorrência de TEV entre 3 semanas (HR 1,4; 1,06-1,84) até 15 meses (HR 1,26;1,01- 1,57) após a descontinuidade da terapêutica com anticoagulantes 24 .

Caso o mesmo se mantenha elevado, é preciso considerar o resultado desses dois artigos científicos, que demonstram incidência quase dobrada de recidiva de TEV em pacientes com níveis elevados de DD quando comparados aos pacientes com níveis normais. Recomendação 2 Dosagem sérica do DD persistentemente elevado após a parada da anticoagulação pode indicar risco de recorrência, porém não prediz maior ou menor risco de recorrência de evento trombótico. Classe I, nível A23. DD e COVID-19 A discussão a respeito do DD e o risco de TEV ganhou atenção especial devido à pandemia da COVID-19, já que foram observados valores altos deste em pacientes acometidos pela infecção, principalmente devido ao seu caráter pró-inflamatório e acometimento vascular e endotelial. Um estudo randomizado, o HEP-COVID, recrutou pacientes infectados pela COVID-19 com valores de DD quatro vezes maiores do que o valor de referência e randomizou os pacientes para tratamento com heparina de baixo peso molecular (HBPM) na dose profilática versus dose terapêutica. O grupo de pacientes infectados pela COVID-19 submetidos ao tratamento com anticoagulação plena apresentou incidência de TEV de 10,9%, comparados aos 29% no grupo de pacientes submetidos à anticoagulação profilática (RR 0,37; IC95% 0,21-0,66; p <.001). Além disso, o grupo de pacientes submetidos à anticoagulação plena apresentou menores taxas de mortalidade (19,4%) em relação aos pacientes submetidos à anticoagulação profilática (25%), (RR 0,68; IC95% 0,49-0,96; p = 0,03) 25 . Alguns estudos e metanálises evidenciaram uma associação entre valores altos de DD e mortalidade por COVID-19, cujo mecanismo fisiopatológico está associado a um estado secundário hiperativo de fibrinólise, ou consumo exacerbado de fibrina 26 . Uma metanálise publicada em 2021 encontrou associação entre o nível elevado de DD e mortalidade em pacientes internados com infecção por COVID-19, com menor probabilidade de alta hospitalar, maior progressão para intubação orotraqueal e ventilação mecânica, mostrando que níveis maiores de DD na admissão hospitalar desses pacientes indicariam um maior estado pró-inflamatório, com uma cascata de interleucinas em ativação máxima e estado de hiperfibrinólise 27 . Outra metanálise, de 2021, avaliou 10.491 pacientes infectados por COVID-19 e evidenciou uma forte associação entre níveis elevados de DD e mau prognóstico na evolução da doença (OR 3,39; IC95% 2,66-4,33; p < 0.00001) 28 . Em suma, os níveis elevados de DD na admissão dos pacientes infectados pela COVID-19 estão associados a um mau prognóstico, com maior risco de TEV, evolução para ventilação mecânica e óbito. Não existe um limite referencial de corte para o valor de DD; entretanto, alguns estudos sugerem que o valor acima de 2,0 μg/mL na admissão dos pacientes poderia ser um fator preditor de mau prognóstico nesses pacientes que necessitem internação 29 . Em resumo, a dosagem sérica do DD em pacientes com COVID-19 desempenha um papel importante na avaliação do estado de coagulação, inflamação e risco de complicações, como trombose e gravidade da doença. No entanto, a interpretação dos resultados deve ser feita considerando o contexto clínico individual e outros marcadores clínicos, e a tomada de decisões clínicas deve ser orientada por profissionais de saúde experientes. DD e a SPT A SPT é uma das mais nefastas complicações da TVP de membros inferiores devido à sua morbidade, com impacto na qualidade de vida e nas atividades socioeconômicas do paciente. Apesar de ser um preditor de processo inflamatório e atividade trombótica, os valores de DD no seguimento de pacientes com TEV não estão relacionados ao desenvolvimento de SPT, como foi documentado em diversos trabalhos na literatura 30,31 . Trombo residual detectado ao EDC, recanalização venosa parcial ou ausente, tipo de anticoagulante administrado durante o tratamento da TVP, refluxo na veia poplítea e idade avançada permanecem como principais fatores de risco determinantes para a SPT. Em resumo, o DD desempenha um papel importante no diagnóstico, acompanhamento e avaliação do risco de TEV em diversos contextos clínicos. Os níveis de DD podem ser influenciados por diferentes fatores, como idade e condições médicas subjacentes, e seu valor prognóstico varia de acordo com o cenário clínico. Portanto, a interpretação adequada dos resultados do DD é fundamental para orientar o diagnóstico e o tratamento de pacientes com TEV e outras condições médicas. Exame de imagem EDC O EDC venoso é o método complementar mais frequentemente utilizado para o diagnóstico de TVP em pacientes sintomáticos. Apresenta menor acurácia em veias distais, em veias de membros superiores e em pacientes assintomáticos 7,9,32,33 . Atualmente, é o exame de escolha para o diagnóstico de TVP 7,9,34 , com sensibilidade de 96% e especificidade de 98 a 100% 35 , em substituição à venografia 7,32,35,36 .",
    "Trombose venosa profunda: diagnóstico e tratamento 5/27 Sobreira et al. J Vasc Bras. 2024;23:e20230107. https://doi.org/10.1590/1677-5449.202301071 Utiliza-se a ultrassonografia em tempo real para avaliar a ausência ou presença de compressibilidade das veias e a ecogenicidade intraluminal. O EDC avalia a anatomia e as características do fluxo venoso, combinando imagem em tempo real e a análise espectral 7,9,37 . A indicação de exame de todo o membro é favorecida, em relação ao exame segmentar ou POCUS (do inglês, point of care ultrasound ), embora ainda seja um assunto polêmico em certas instituições 38 . No paciente com alta probabilidade de acordo com o EW, EDC negativo e DD positivo, o EDC deverá ser repetido em 3 a 7 dias. Nos casos de TVP recorrente ipsilateral, os critérios utilizados para o diagnóstico pelo EDC são: aumento do diâmetro do mesmo segmento acometido ≥ 4 mm, aumento de 9 cm de extensão do trombo, ou em segmento venoso distinto do acometido previamente 36 . O EDC pode distinguir entre processos patológicos não vasculares, como adenopatia inguinal, cisto de Baker, abscesso e hematomas, entre outros. No seguimento dos pacientes diagnosticados com TVP aguda, o consenso da Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound de 2018 recomenda a utilização do termo “alterações pós-trombóticas crônicas” em vez de “TVP crônica”, a fim de evitar confusão com a TVP em curso. Também recomenda cautela no emprego do termo “TVP subaguda”, devido à dificuldade na sua caracterização 39,40 . O EDC desempenha um papel fundamental no diagnóstico de TVP, oferecendo alta sensibilidade e especificidade. Além disso, é útil no seguimento de pacientes com TVP aguda, permitindo a diferenciação de outras condições não vasculares. A terminologia recomendada para descrever alterações pós-trombóticas crônicas visa evitar confusões na comunicação médica. A EDC e a dosagem sérica do DD é frequentemente usada para o diagnóstico e confirmação da TVP. A sensibilidade e especificidade dessa combinação podem variar dependendo das circunstâncias clínicas, dos critérios de diagnóstico e dos valores de corte utilizados para o DD. No entanto, em geral: 1. Sensibilidade: A combinação de EDC e dosagem de DD é conhecida por apresentar alta sensibilidade. Isso significa que a maioria dos casos de TVP é identificada corretamente por essa abordagem. A sensibilidade pode variar, mas muitos estudos relatam sensibilidades superiores a 90% para o diagnóstico de TVP; 2. Especificidade: A especificidade da combinação EDC e DD é geralmente alta, mas pode ser menor do que a sensibilidade. Isso ocorre porque a elevação dos níveis de DD pode ocorrer em várias condições médicas além da TVP, como infecções, inflamações e doenças crônicas. Portanto, a especificidade pode variar, mas é comum encontrar valores acima de 80% para a combinação. É importante ressaltar que os valores de corte para o DD podem afetar a sensibilidade e especificidade da abordagem. Valores de corte mais baixos aumentarão a sensibilidade, mas podem diminuir a especificidade, enquanto valores de corte mais altos aumentarão a especificidade, mas podem diminuir a sensibilidade. Recomendação 3 EW de moderada ou baixa probabilidade associado com dosagem sérica de DD normal podem prescindir da necessidade de realização de EDC, para exclusão diagnóstica. Classe II nível C23 Recomendação 4 EW de alta probabilidade associado com dosagem sérica de DD elevada sugerem necessidade de realização de EDC, para confirmação diagnóstica. Classe II nível C23. Venografia/flebografia A flebografia é o exame considerado padrão-ouro para o diagnóstico de TVP, reservado, atualmente, apenas quando os outros testes são incapazes de definir o diagnóstico. Porém, devido a várias limitações (custo, reações adversas ao contraste, ser desconfortável para o paciente, contraindicado a pacientes com insuficiência renal e usar radiação), não é o exame de rotina utilizado na suspeita de TVP. Tem acurácia limitada nos quadros de TVP recorrente 1 . A flebografia pode ser útil nos casos em que a EDC sugere a presença de obstrução proximal ao demonstrar perda da fasicidade do fluxo, mas não consegue visualizar o trombo nas veias ilíacas 41 . Angiotomografia computadorizada (ATC) Como a sensibilidade e especificidade da ATC são similares à do EDC, não há evidência suficiente para recomendá-la como modalidade diagnóstica inicial para TVP 36 . Em metanálise realizada por Thomas et al. 42 , a sensibilidade encontrada para ATC foi de 96% (IC95% 93-98), e especificidade de 95% (IC95% 94-97) para diagnóstico de TVP proximal em pacientes com suspeita de EP. Pode ser útil para pacientes com suspeita de TVP, para os quais o EDC não pode ser aplicado devido a limitações técnicas e suspeita de anomalia venosa 36 . O uso da ATC tem o benefício de avaliar as veias pélvicas e a veia cava inferior (VCI), cuja avaliação é limitada no EDC, além de detectar outras etiologias de edema de membros inferiores, como neoplasia pélvica ou compressão extrínseca por outras estruturas vasculares, incluindo a síndrome de compressão da veia ilíaca comum esquerda (síndrome de May-Thurner) 43 .",
    "Trombose venosa profunda: diagnóstico e tratamento 6/27 Sobreira et al. J Vasc Bras. 2024;23:e20230107. https://doi.org/10.1590/1677-5449.202301071 Peterson et al. 4 4 demonstraram que, embora a sensibilidade seja alta, em 93%, produzindo um valor preditivo negativo de 97%, a capacidade da ATC venosa para diagnosticar TVP tem uma especificidade de 71%, dando um valor preditivo positivo de apenas 53%; outros pesquisadores mostraram uma taxa de falso positivo de 50% para ATC venosa para TVP pélvica. Angiorressonância magnética (ARM) A ARM pode ser utilizada para o diagnóstico de TVP em casos onde o EDC oferece resultados inconclusivos 36,45 . Apresenta acurácia similar ao EDC no diagnóstico da TVP do segmento ilíaco-caval 42,46 . A ARM com imagem direta do trombo, baseada nas propriedades paramagnéticas da metaemoglobina, pode ser o método de escolha para suspeita de recorrência aguda de TVP, distinguindo um evento novo de um antigo 36 . Estudos comparando a ARM com a flebografia encontraram sensibilidade e especificidade da ARM de até 100% para o diagnóstico de TVP fêmoro- poplítea, porém a acurácia foi menor para trombos distais. Na avaliação de TVP proximal, a ARM tem acurácia semelhante ao EDC e à flebografia, com o benefício de altas taxas de detecção da extensão proximal do trombo e trombos pélvicos isolados 47 . Embora a ARM demonstre excelente precisão para a detecção de TVP aguda, ela apresenta várias desvantagens. O exame requer um paciente imóvel para tempos de imagem longos, e não pode ser usado em pacientes com dispositivos ou clipes metálicos. O contraste utilizado, gadolínio, pode ser tóxico em pacientes com disfunção renal, e a necessidade de exames frequentes pode produzir problemas de utilização em instituições maiores. Finalmente, a qualidade da ARM depende da experiência técnica da instituição 47 . Em resumo, a venografia/flebografia é o padrão- ouro, mas é reservada para casos em que outros testes não fornecem diagnóstico. A ATC tem sensibilidade e especificidade semelhantes à EDC, enquanto a ARM é útil em casos de EDC inconclusivo e pode distinguir eventos novos de antigos em recorrências. A escolha da modalidade depende das circunstâncias clínicas e das limitações técnicas e de segurança do paciente. Pode-se optar pela realização de ATC ou ARM (em comparação com a venografia) quando não for possível a realização do EDC. TRATAMENTO Anticoagulação no evento agudo (pacientes convencionais) O tratamento da TVP é um desafio e tem como base o uso de anticoagulantes, a fim de evitar a progressão do trombo enquanto a ativação dos mecanismos fibrinolíticos primários promove a sua dissolução 48-51 . A escolha do anticoagulante inicial inclui: disponibilidade; familiaridade de uso pela equipe médica; características farmacocinéticas e dinâmicas; comorbidades do paciente; facilidade de reversão de seu efeito; e até preferência do paciente e seu custo 52 . Hoje, temos disponíveis para uso no Brasil a heparina não fracionada (HNF), as HBPM, a fondaparinux, os antagonistas da vitamina K (AVKs) e os DOACs (do inglês, direct oral anticoagulants ). Não há anticoagulante totalmente seguro no que diz respeito a hemorragias. Assim, na prática clínica, o risco de hemorragia deve ser sempre avaliado no tratamento do TEV. Os diversos anticoagulantes podem apresentar diferentes riscos para hemorragias, dependendo: da intensidade do tratamento; do uso concomitante de outros anticoagulantes, drogas trombolíticas ou antiplaquetárias; características do paciente; e comorbidades 53 . Recomendação 5 Em pacientes com TVP proximal, a abordagem preferencial é geralmente o uso de terapia anticoagulante como tratamento primário, em vez de combinar com terapia trombolítica. Classe II nível C53-55. Duração da anticoagulação O objetivo em prolongar a duração do tratamento é prevenir a recorrência de TVP. O risco é menor se a TVP ocorre na presença de fatores de risco reversíveis, como por exemplo cirurgias; e maior, se a TVP for idiopática ou associada ao câncer. Pacientes com EP sintomática também têm maior risco de recorrência do que aqueles com apenas TVP. O risco também é maior na presença de outros complicadores, tais como trombofilias hereditárias em homozigose, síndrome do anticorpo fosfolipídio ou combinação de trombofilias 53 . Anticoagulação inicial para TVP aguda de membros inferiores Para pacientes com alta suspeita clínica de TVP, recomenda-se iniciar o tratamento com anticoagulantes enquanto se aguarda a confirmação do diagnóstico, desde que não haja contraindicação 54 . Na maioria dos pacientes com TVP proximal, sugere-se terapia anticoagulante isolada em vez de associação com terapia trombolítica (recomendação condicional, baixa certeza), conforme demonstrado na Tabela 1 . Observações Pacientes com membro ameaçado por TVP podem requerer trombólise. Em pacientes com TEV ( Tabela 2 ), sugere-se o uso de DOACs ao invés de AVKs (recomendação condicional, certeza moderada).",
    "Trombose venosa profunda: diagnóstico e tratamento 7/27 Sobreira et al. J Vasc Bras. 2024;23:e20230107. https://doi.org/10.1590/1677-5449.202301071 A orientação não serve para todos pacientes, como no caso dos portadores de SAF triplo positivo – quando os DOACs são contraindicados. Não se sugere um DOAC sobre outro. Recomenda-se, com alto nível de evidência, o tratamento inicial com HBPM subcutânea (SC), HNF endovenosa (EV) ou SC monitorizada, dose fixa de HNF SC, ou fondaparinux SC, seguida de anticoagulantes orais a longo prazo. Recomenda-se a duração do tratamento inicial (HNF, HBPM ou fondaparinux) por pelo menos 5 dias, associado aos AVKs desde o 1º dia de tratamento, até que o RNI (relação de normatização internacional) esteja no nível terapêutico, entre dois e três, por 2 dias consecutivos. A partir desse momento, as drogas parenterais podem ser suspensas com segurança. Não recomendamos, em hipótese alguma, o tratamento inicial para TVP somente com AVKs, uma vez que está associado a altas taxas de recorrência sintomática e risco de necrose cutânea. Uma alternativa a AVK é o uso de DOACs, como a edoxabana e a dabigatrana, a partir do 5º dia após heparinização ou apixabana ou rivaroxabana sem necessidade de ponte inicial com anticogulante parenteral. HBPM As HBPMs têm biodisponibilidade previsível, portanto, não se recomenda a monitorização dos níveis de antifator Xa como rotina 42,45 (A). No entanto, devem ser realizados hemogramas com contagem de plaquetas. Podem ser administradas uma ou duas vezes ao dia, em regime hospitalar ou domiciliar. HBPM versus varfarina Tratamento a longo prazo (mais que 35 dias) com HBPM é tão efetivo quanto varfarina, para prevenção de mortes e recorrência de TEV, com risco similar de hemorragias. HBPM versus HNF Comparado com as HNFs, as HBPMs no tratamento prolongado (3 a 6 meses) apresentam risco menor de hemorragia grave e redução de recorrência de TVP proximal, com menos efeitos adversos. Em pacientes com EP aguda, as HBPMs são tão efetivas e seguras quanto as HNFs. Em pacientes com TVP aguda e insuficiência renal grave, sugere-se o tratamento com HNF ao invés de HBPM. HNF EV Caso a HNF seja o tratamento inicial de escolha, recomenda-se que, após o bolus EV (80 U/Kg ou 5.000 U), sua administração em infusão venosa contínua (inicialmente na dose de 18 U/Kg/h ou 1.300 U/h) com ajuste de dose para obter e manter um TTPa entre 1,5 e 2,5 acima do basal. HNF SC Se utilizadas doses fixas, recomenda-se uma dose inicial de 333 U/Kg seguida de 250 U/Kg duas vezes ao dia, realizando tratamento de acordo com o peso do paciente, com ajuste de dose para obter e manter um TTPa entre 1,5 e 2,5 acima do basal. HBPM versus fondaparinux O fondaparinux não é inferior à HBPM em taxas de recorrência de TEV, hemorragia grave ou morte. AVKs Os AVKs devem ser iniciados no 1º dia de terapia, associados à HNF, HBPM ou fondaparinux, exceto nos pacientes que tenham contraindicação ao seu uso. Tratamento com AVK requer mensuração frequente do RNI e monitorização das interações alimentares e com outras drogas. Varfarina Alcançar o RNI em nível terapêutico (entre dois e três) o mais breve possível é importante, uma vez que diminui a duração do tempo de uso de anticoagulantes parenterais e os custos. Embora a dose de 5 mg tenda a prevenir a anticoagulação excessiva, a dose inicial de 10 mg pode alcançar mais rapidamente o RNI terapêutico. Em revisão sistemática que avaliou a eficácia de uma dose inicial de 10 mg de varfarina comparada com 5 mg em pacientes com TEV, não foram observadas diferenças entre elas em relação à recorrência de TEV, às hemorragias menores ou graves e à duração do período de internação.

Anticoagulantes orais diretos Nos últimos anos, quatro DOACs – rivaroxabana, edoxabana, apixabana e dabigatrana – foram disponibilizados no mercado brasileiro, com algumas vantagens quando comparados aos AVK, como dose fixa, menos interações medicamentosas e alimentares, início de ação rápido e meia-vida curta, bem como ausência de necessidade de monitoramento regular 55,56 . Rivaroxabana A rivaroxabana é uma molécula, com peso molecular de 436 g/mol 20 . Seu mecanismo de ação consiste na inibição direta do fator Xa 57 . O fármaco apresenta rápida absorção por via oral, concentração plasmática em 2 a 4h e meia-vida de 6 a 7h 56,57 . O seu metabolismo é hepático e seu uso deve ser evitado em indivíduos com doença hepática moderada a grave 56,58 . Sua excreção é por via renal 10,1 3 e sua dose deve ser ajustada em pacientes com insuficiência renal crônica (IRC), clearance de creatinina (ClCr) entre 15 e 50 mL/min, seu uso não é recomendado com ClCr <15 mL/min 13 . A rivaroxabana possui interação medicamentosa com fármacos inibidores da glicoproteína P e a XYP3A4 59,60 . O estudo Einstein DVT demonstrou que a rivaroxabana é tão eficaz quanto o uso de HBPM e varfarina no tratamento da TVP em relação à taxa de recorrência (2,1% vs 3%; p < 0,001 para não inferioridade) com mesmo risco de complicações. Estudos como o Einstein EXTENSION e Einstein CHOICE demonstraram ainda emprego factível com baixo risco de sangramentos graves em uso mais prolongado, de até 12 meses. A dose habitual sem insuficiência renal é de 15 mg, por via oral, de 12 em 12 horas por 21 dias e, após, 20 mg em dose oral única diária pelo tempo previsto para tratamento 56,61,62 . Não há necessidade de uso de droga parenteral inicial concomitante. Seu efeito anticoagulante pode ser revertido pelo andexanet alfa 57,61,62 . Edoxabana A edoxabana é um anticoagulante oral cuja atividade se dá mediante inibição direta do fator Xa 63,64 . Sua absorção ocorre, principalmente, no duodeno e no jejuno proximal 65-67 , e pode ser administrada junto com a alimentação 68,69 . Sua absorção ocorre em 1 a 2 horas, e sua meia-vida é de 5,8 a 10,7 horas 70-75 . A dose diária é de 60 mg, em dose única diária, iniciada após 5 dias de tratamento com HNF ou HBPM 76,77 . Seu uso é contraindicado em pacientes com ClCr <15 mL/min 78 . A edoxabana tem potencial para o uso em crianças (considerando os estudos pré-clínicos de Fase I) 79,80 . No estudo Hokusai-VTE, observou-se que após o tratamento inicial com heparinas, a edoxabana foi não inferior à terapia padrão com heparina e varfarina 81 . A edoxabana foi mais eficaz que a varfarina em pacientes com idade ≥ 75 anos e naqueles com múltiplas comorbidades 74,75 . A edoxabana também se mostrou eficaz e segura no tratamento de TEV associada ao câncer 80,82 . Sua dose deve ser reduzida para 30 mg, dose única diária, em pacientes com perda moderada da função renal (CrCl de 15-50 nL/min), peso menor ou igual a 60 kg ou que utilize inibidores da glicoproteína P. Apixabana A apixabana é um anticoagulante oral, inibidor direto do fator Xa. Foi aprovada para uso médico no Brasil em julho de 2011, para tratamento e prevenção secundária do TEV 83-85 . Sua absorção se dá, principalmente, no duodeno e no jejuno proximal 86-88 . As concentrações plasmáticas máximas ocorrem em 3 a 4h, com meia-vida de 6h 86,87,89-91 . O acompanhamento laboratorial da sua atividade não se faz necessária 92,93 . Para o tratamento na fase aguda do TEV, recomenda-se a dose de 10 mg, via oral, duas vezes ao dia por 5 dias, depois, 5 mg, duas vezes ao dia 91,94,95 . Não há necessidade do uso concomitante de anticoagulante parenteral. Para a terapia estendida de TEV após 6 meses de terapia anticoagulante inicial, pode ser usada a dose de 2,5 mg, por via oral, duas vezes ao dia, a fim de reduzir a recorrência 87,96-98 . Não há dados adequados sobre seu uso em mulheres grávidas e amamentação 99 . A segurança e a eficácia ainda não foram estabelecidas em pacientes com idade <18 anos 87,98-100 . Não se indica o uso em pacientes com insuficiência hepática grave 87 . O ajuste da dose com base apenas na função renal não é necessário no tratamento do TEV, porém está contraindicada em pacientes com ClCr <15 mL/min 87,100 . Dabigatrana O etexilato de dabigatrana mostra-se um inibidor reversível do sítio ativo da trombina. Prescinde de monitoramento laboratorial. Seu uso não é recomendado em pacientes com insuficiência renal com CrCl <30 mL/ min. Como os outros DOACs, é contraindicado em pacientes com doença hepática avançada 101 . Os estudos RE-COVER, RE-COVER II, RE-MEDY e RE-SONATE observaram não inferioridade em eficácia no tratamento da EP (fatal ou não fatal), EP e/ou recidiva de TVP com dabigatrana, quando comparada à terapia padrão com varfarina após o uso inicial de 5 a 10 dias de anticoagulação parenteral. Apresenta concentração máxima plasmática 0,5 a 2h após a administração, com pico de concentração plasmática após 6h, e meia-vida de 11h. Seu efeito colateral mais importante é o sangramento. Pode ter sua ação revertida pelo idarucizumabe. Além",

Recomendação 10 Após o tratamento inicial de TEV não provocada, é recomendado um regime indefinido de anticoagulação. Para pacientes que permanecerão com DOAC para prevenção secundária, a sugestão é a utilização do DOAC em dose padrão ou em dose reduzida (por exemplo, rivaroxabana 10 mg/dia ou apixabana 2,5 mg, duas vezes ao dia). Classe II nível B 11,53,54 . Recomendação 11 Em pacientes com indicação de profilaxia secundária do TEV não associado a câncer, recomenda-se o uso de DOACs em baixas doses (rivaroxabana 10 mg/dia ou apixabana 2,5 mg de 12 em 12 h) sobre DOACs em doses maiores, dicumarínicos ou AAS.

Recomendação 13 Em pacientes com indicação de profilaxia secundária do TEV e SAF, recomenda-se a profilaxia secundária com o uso de dicumarínicos. Classe I, nível A 112,113 . Anticoagulação no TEV agudo na IRC A IRC é uma doença de caráter paradoxal no tratamento do TEV, pois, ao mesmo tempo que aumenta o risco de recorrência devido à disfunção endotelial, hiperreatividade plaquetária inicial, aumento da formação de fibrina e diminuição da atividade fibrinolítica, também aumenta o risco de hemorragia maior, com a piora progressiva da doença, devido à diminuição da agregação plaquetária 114 . Esse equilíbrio tênue entre o risco de recorrência e de hemorragia torna o tratamento do TEV um desafio especialmente naqueles com IRC de moderada a grave (ClCr entre 15 e 59 mL/min) ou IRC terminal (ClCr < 15 mL/min) 114 . Pacientes com IRC e TEV são tradicionalmente tratados com HNF, por via endovenosa, seguido de varfarina, com RNI alvo entre 2 e 3 115 . Para pacientes com TEV e IRC terminal (CrCl <15 mL/min), as HBPM, a fondaparinux e os DOACs não são recomendados 115,116 . Já na IRC de moderada a grave (CrCl entre 15 e 59 mL/min), as HBPM ou fondaparinux podem ser prescritos com cautela, em dose ajustada, eventualmente, com monitoramento dos níveis de anti- Xa, ou não recomendado, para evitar a bioacumulação e sangramento, particularmente na IRC avançada (CrCl <30 mL/min) 115,117 . A eficácia e segurança de DOACs, com eventuais ajustes de dose, em pacientes com TEV e com IRC leve a moderada (CrCl entre 30 e 80 mL/min) foram confirmadas no tratamento inicial e de extensão do TEV 115 . A edoxabana é o único dos DOACs que prevê a redução de dose no tratamento agudo do TEV para pacientes com IRC (ClCr entre 30 e 50 mL/min), de 60 para 30 mg, via oral, uma vez ao dia, mantendo a mesma eficácia e segurança 118 . Nesses pacientes, é fundamental a reavaliação periódica da função renal. Anticoagulação no TEV agudo em mulheres Nos países desenvolvidos, onde as causas clássicas de óbito materno na gestação, como eclâmpsia e hemorragia, foram controladas, o TEV passou a ser a principal preocupação, e sua prevenção, embasada em diretrizes apoiadas por evidências, com a instituição de farmacoprofilaxia em pacientes selecionadas, é ainda a melhor estratégia para reduzir essa complicação, potencialmente fatal. A escolha dos métodos contraceptivos e de terapia de reposição hormonal (TRH) devem ser feitas por criteriosa seleção, avaliando os critérios de elegibilidade, as contraindicações e a autonomia das pacientes. Tanto o seu uso indiscriminado quanto a proibição imotivada são condutas inadequadas. Os contraceptivos hormonais e a TRH aumentam o risco de TEV; porém, as mulheres não devem ser privadas dos seus benefícios, além da contracepção, que as tornam mais livres na idade fértil e menos sintomáticas no climatério. A fertilização assistida e terapia hormonal (TH) em mulheres transgênero também estão associadas ao desenvolvimento de TEV, e sua prevenção vai depender da indicação correta e da adequada profilaxia naquelas pacientes consideradas de alto risco para o desenvolvimento dessa doença. TEV no ciclo gravídico-puerperal As gestantes apresentam os três componentes etiopatogênicos da tríade de Virchow: a) estase venosa, causada pela compressão da VCI e veia ilíaca comum esquerda pelo útero gravídico e pela redução do tônus venoso pela ação miorrelaxante da progesterona; b) hipercoagulabilidade, secundária à indução da síntese hepática dos fatores VII, VIII e X da coagulação pelo estriol placentário, aumento dos níveis de fibrinogênio e inibidores dos ativadores do plasminogênio I e II e redução da síntese da proteína S; c) lesão endotelial, que ocorre durante a nidação, remodelamento endovascular das artérias espirais uterinas e expulsão da placenta 119,120 .",
    "Trombose venosa profunda: diagnóstico e tratamento 12/27 Sobreira et al. J Vasc Bras. 2024;23:e20230107. https://doi.org/10.1590/1677-5449.202301071 Durante a gravidez, o risco de TEV aumenta entre cinco e dez vezes, podendo ser 35 vezes maior no puerpério quando comparada com a taxa entre mulheres não grávidas da mesma idade. Após o parto, a sua prevalência diminui rapidamente; mas há um risco residual por até cerca de 12 semanas. Aproximadamente dois terços das TVP ocorrem durante o período gestacional, distribuídos igualmente pelos 3 trimestres. No entanto, 43 a 60% dos episódios de EP ocorrem durante as primeiras 6 semanas do puerpério 119,120 . Entre as gestantes, quando comparadas com as não gestantes, as TVPs no membro inferior esquerdo (90% versus 55%) e no segmento iliofemoral (72% versus 9%) são ainda mais predominantes. Isso se deve à compressão acentuada da veia cava e da veia ilíaca comum esquerda contra a quinta vértebra lombar, causada pelo útero gravídico em crescimento 119,120 . Os principais fatores de risco para TEV durante a gestação e puerpério são: sobrepeso; obesidade; idade igual ou superior a 35 anos; trombofilias hereditárias ou adquiridas; viagens de longa distância; imobilidade; internação hospitalar no período gestacional; multiparidade; tabagismo; comorbidades, como por exemplo doença inflamatória intestinal; infecção do trato urinário; lúpus sistêmico eritematoso; hipertensão arterial sistêmica induzida pela gravidez ou pré-eclâmpsia; cirurgia pré-natal não obstétrica; hemorragia; transfusão e hiperêmese gravídica; entre outros. A prevenção do TEV na gravidez, por meio da aplicação de diretrizes baseadas em evidências ou modelos de avaliação de risco e a implementação de profilaxia mecânica e/ou farmacológica, ainda é a melhor estratégia para reduzir a taxa desses eventos 119,120 . Peculiaridades do tratamento anticoagulante durante a gestação e puerpério. A administração de varfarina entre a 6ª e a 12ª semanas de gestação pode induzir embriopatia fetal (hipoplasia nasal e/ou pontilhado das epífises), anormalidades do sistema nervoso central (displasia da linha média dorsal com agenesia do corpo caloso, atrofia do cerebelo linha média, displasia da linha média ventral com atrofia óptica e amaurose e hemorragia) e sangramento fetal 121 . No entanto, a varfarina é segura e pode ser prescrita durante todo o período de amamentação 121 . Os DOACs são contraindicados na gestação, por atravessarem a barreira placentária, e na amamentação, por passarem para o leite materno 121 . Portanto, o tratamento do TEV nesses períodos deve ser preferencialmente feito com HNF, ou, preferencialmente, HBPM, quando houver restrições ao uso dessas 122 . O uso de fondaprinux durante a gestação tem indicação restrita e com evidência de baixa qualidade - a recomendação do ACCP geralmente era de grau 2C, indicando um grau moderado de recomendação baseado em evidências de baixa qualidade ou consenso de opiniões de especialistas 54,84 . Recomendação 14 Durante a gravidez e amamentação, recomendamos contra o uso de DOACs Para tratamento de TEV na gestação, recomenda-se HNF ou HBPM. Classe I nível B (HNF x HBPM) e Classe I nível A (HBPM x AVK) 54,84,121,122 Escolha da via de parto em mulheres em anticoagulação A escolha da via de parto é obstétrica e não há contraindicação contra a maturação cervical artificial ou indução do parto. O parto da gestante em vigência de anticoagulação deve ser programado para o período entre 37 e 40 semanas 123 . A HBPM deve ser suspensa 12h antes do parto se administrada em dosagens profiláticas, ou 24h antes se administrada em dosagens intermediárias ou terapêuticas, permitindo a administração segura de raquianestesia ou da anestesia peridural 123,124 . Independentemente da farmacoprofilaxia e da via de parto escolhida, a gestante deve fazer uso de meia elástica antitrombo durante todo o procedimento 4 . Embora o risco associado à cesariana isoladamente seja baixo, a incidência de TEV aumenta quando existem outros fatores de risco associados. Portanto, a tromboprofilaxia deve ser prescrita, com base na estratificação de risco de cada gestante, com modelo de avaliação de risco validado 123,124 . TEV e contracepção No Brasil, uma em cada cinco mulheres usa anticoncepcionais orais (ACOs) que oferecem benefícios que vão além da contracepção, como redução do sangramento menstrual, dismenorreia, síndrome pré-menstrual, enxaqueca, acne e hirsutismo. Além disto, os ACOs têm benefícios a longo prazo, como, por exemplo, a diminuição da incidência de câncer de endométrio, ovário e colorretal 122 . Os ACOs aumentam o risco de TEV de uma taxa inicial de 5/10.000 mulheres-ano entre não usuárias para 9-10/10.000 mulheres/ano entre usuárias. Para manter esse risco em perspectiva, é importante lembrar que o risco de TEV é de 29/10.000 durante o período gestacional e 300-400/10.000 no puerpério 122 . O risco tromboembólico dos ACOs está relacionado à dosagem de estrogênio e do tipo de progestágeno combinado a ele. ACOs antigos com altos níveis de estrogênio (>50 μg de etinilestradiol) estão associados a um risco maior de TEV do que os ACOs mais modernos (<50 μg de etinilestradiol). Não obstante, nenhuma redução de risco foi confirmada com os ACOs contendo 20 μg de etinilestradiol em comparação",
    "Trombose venosa profunda: diagnóstico e tratamento 13/27 Sobreira et al. J Vasc Bras. 2024;23:e20230107. https://doi.org/10.1590/1677-5449.202301071 com aqueles que contém 30 μg de etinilestradiol 122 . O tipo de progestágeno também influencia o risco de TEV, e os progestágenos de segunda geração (levonorgestrel [LNG] e noretisterona) são mais seguros do que os de terceira e quarta geração 122 . O risco de TEV associado a ACOs está vinculado ao aumento do peso corporal e da idade e com a reintrodução ou mudança de ACOs após suspensão superior a 4 semanas. Entre as usuárias de ACOs, portadoras de trombofilias hereditárias têm maior risco de desenvolvimento de TEV. No entanto, devido à sua baixa prevalência na população geral e ao alto custo dos exames laboratoriais diagnósticos, a investigação de trombofilias hereditárias de rotina não é recomendada 122 . A história pessoal ou familiar de TEV é um fator de risco mais importante e mais comum para TEV associado a ACOs 122 . Os contraceptivos não orais, incluindo adesivos e anéis vaginais, também estão associados ao aumento do risco de TEV, elevando o seu risco em 7,9 e 6,5 vezes, respectivamente 122 . A coagulação não apresenta alterações significativas com o uso de ACOs exclusivos de progesterona, implantes contendo LNG, sistema intrauterino de LNG ou injeção de medroxiprogesterona em depósito. Portanto, o seu uso é seguro nessa situação 122 . TEV e fertilização assistida A fertilização in vitro (FIV) é a técnica mais utilizada para a reprodução humana em casais inférteis, e o TEV é uma complicação rara dessa técnica, ocorrendo em 0,1 a 2,4% dos ciclos de fertilização 10 2. O risco de TEV dobra nas gestações após uma FIV, quando comparado com o risco basal de gestantes não submetidas a ela. Isso se deve, particularmente, ao aumento de 5 a 10 vezes do risco durante o 1º trimestre de gestações após a FIV, secundário à síndrome de hiperestimulação ovariana (SHO), uma complicação iatrogênica e potencialmente fatal que ocorre em 33% de todos os ciclos gerados pela FIV. Mulheres que desenvolvem a SHO têm risco 100 vezes maior de TEV e, na SHO grave, a tromboprofilaxia com HBPM reduz a incidência do TEV, sem provocar aumento significativo de sangramento 122 . O TEV associado à FIV ocorre com maior frequência entre o 40º e 42º dia após a transferência do embrião, e tem a propensão de localizar-se em extremidades superiores e na região cervical em vez de no membro inferior esquerdo, local mais frequente nas gestações espontâneas 122 . A FIV também aumenta o risco de trombose arterial, que ocorre em média no 10º dia após a transferência do embrião 122 . TEV e TRH Embora dados recentes mostrem que os riscos da TRH podem superar os seus benefícios, muitas mulheres ainda são submetidas à TRH com estrógenos, de forma indiscriminada, para minimizar os sintomas do climatério. Essa conduta está associada ao aumento da incidência do TEV, principalmente no 1º ano de seu uso. Além disso, as mulheres com útero também recebem progestágenos para neutralizar o risco de câncer de endométrio na TRH, o que pode ser um fator de risco adicional para o desenvolvimento de TEV 122 . Estudos observacionais, revisões sistemáticas e metanálises relatam consistentemente um risco duas a três vezes maior de TEV entre mulheres pós-menopáusicas em TRH quando comparadas a mulheres pós-menopáusicas não submetidas à TRH 122 . O risco de TEV em mulheres submetidas à TRH é dependente da via de administração. Os estrógenos por via oral provocam alterações pró- coagulantes, como aumento da resistência à proteína C ativada, por redução da concentração sérica da proteína S e redução da atividade fibrinolítica, provavelmente pela sua passagem e metabolização pelo fígado, porém, essas alterações não são observadas na TRH pela via trans. Não há dados adequados sobre seu uso em mulheres grávidas e amamentação dérmica 122 . Para prevenir TEV em mulheres que serão submetidas TRH, é importante identificar aquelas mais suscetíveis. Aquelas com história pessoal e familial de TEV são consideradas de alto risco e, portanto, não são candidatas à TRH com estrógenos por via oral 122 . A TRH, de fato, é o tratamento mais eficaz para minimizar os sintomas do climatério associados à queda dos níveis de estrogênio na menopausa. Porém, ela não deve ser prescrita de forma indiscriminada. Após avaliação dos seus riscos e benefícios, a melhor estratégia para proteger do risco de TEV é prescrição da TRH com a menor dose de estrógeno possível, por via transdérmica, isoladamente ou combinada com progestágenos micronizados, pelo menor tempo possível 123 . TEV em mulheres transgênero Os termos transgênero e não conformidade de gênero descrevem uma situação em que a identidade de gênero de uma pessoa difere da anatomia sexual externa com a qual ela nasceu. Os objetivos da afirmação de gênero em mulheres transgênero são suprimir as características masculinas e induzir características femininas, na medida do possível. A provisão de TH e da cirurgia para afirmação de gênero orientada por médico e amparada pelo sistema de saúde mostrou melhora na qualidade de vida e redução dos distúrbios observados nessa população, incluindo TEV 124 . Diversos estudos têm demonstrado um risco aumentado de TEV em mulheres transgênero que fazem uso de TH, e este risco está relacionado ao tipo e dosagem dos",
    "Trombose venosa profunda: diagnóstico e tratamento 14/27 Sobreira et al. J Vasc Bras. 2024;23:e20230107. https://doi.org/10.1590/1677-5449.202301071 hormônios empregados e, principalmente, à sua via de administração. Sendo a administração transdérmica a via preferencial em mulheres transgênero com história pessoal ou familial de TEV ou naquelas portadoras de trombofilias hereditárias 124 . Vale ressaltar que, para essa população, a TH não é eletiva, mas, sim, uma necessidade absoluta para se obter o fenótipo desejado, e em muitos lugares estão à margem da sociedade, não possuindo acesso aos profissionais ou serviços habilitados para prescrevê-la. Como consequência, muitas vezes a TH é obtida de forma ilegal e ingerida por conta própria, sem orientação profissional quanto à composição, doses e vias seguras. Outro ponto para reflexão é que as vias não orais da TH são usualmente mais caras do que a via oral e, portanto, inacessíveis para a maioria 124 . Uma estratégia plausível para atenuar o risco de TEV em grupos de risco é o início concomitante da anticoagulação profilática com a TH, especialmente nos primeiros 6 a 12 meses de tratamento 124 . A prescrição adequada da contracepção e da TRH também demanda maturidade e conhecimento médico. A simples proibição do uso de ACOs e de TRH sem avaliar cuidadosamente os fatores de risco e a história familial e pessoal de cada paciente não interfere de forma decisiva na ocorrência de TEV e expõe desnecessariamente as mulheres ao risco de uma gestação indesejada e/ou a queda da qualidade de vida em qualquer faixa etária. Anticoagulação estendida – profilaxia secundária A profilaxia secundária do TEV, também denominada “terapia estendida”, consiste na manutenção de terapia antitrombótica (anticoagulantes ou, menos frequentemente, antiagregantes plaquetários) após o período inicial de tratamento do TEV agudo (3 a 6 meses), com o intuito de prevenir sua recorrência. A incidência de um novo evento de TEV após seu tratamento inicial pode superar os 40% em 10 anos 125 . Porém, é possível identificar indivíduos com maior risco de recorrência e assim orientar a anticoagulação estendida para pacientes que irão se beneficiar de tal estratégia. Para a indicação da profilaxia secundária do TEV, deve-se levar em consideração dois fatores elementares na tomada de decisão: o risco de recorrência do TEV e o risco de sangramento do paciente sob anticoagulação. Dessa forma, o risco de recorrência pra TEV deve ser estimado, considerando que há fatores que caracterizam risco baixo, intermediário e alto, conforme pormenorizados na Tabela 1 . Pacientes com baixo risco de recorrência não têm indicação de extensão profilaxia secundária 104,126 . De maneira oposta, paciente com TEV de repetição sem fatores de risco identificáveis ou com fatores de risco persistentes costumam se beneficiar da extensão 103 . Por fim, portadores de risco intermediário para TEV usualmente se beneficiam da profilaxia secundária, desde que apresentem baixo risco de sangramento 105-107 . Quanto maior o fator de risco transitório, menor a chance de recorrência, pois o TEV só se deu na presença de um estímulo trombótico forte. Já a ocorrência de TEV na presença de fatores de risco menores está associada a maior risco de recorrência. O racional dessa evidência consiste no fato de que pacientes que desenvolveram TEV mesmo na presença de estímulos fracos apresentam maior propensão à recorrência 105 , conforme apresentado na Tabela 9 . A profilaxia secundária com AAS ou varfarina em baixas doses (meta de RNI entre 1,5-2,0) não demonstrou boa relação de eficácia e segurança na prevenção de recorrência TEV 128-130 . Mais recentemente, com o advento dos DOACs e a superioridade destes nos desfechos de segurança 108-111 , novas investigações foram realizadas, validando seu uso no tratamento inicial e estendido do TEV. Tais estudos são apresentados na Tabela 10 . Os DOACs têm demonstrado, em seus estudos de Fase IV, resultados de eficácia e segurança similares aos ensaios clínicos randomizados de Fase III 131-141 . A dabigatrana mostrou superioridade ao placebo e não inferioridade à varfarina na redução da recorrência Tabela 9.

Comparativamente ao placebo, a dabigatrana apresentou mais eventos de sangramento, embora sem diferença estatística nos eventos de sangramento maior. A dabigatrana apresentou superioridade na redução de eventos de sangramento clinicamente relevante e não inferioridade na incidência de sangramentos maiores que a varfarina 108 . A eficácia e segurança da rivaroxabana foram testadas em duas investigações distintas 1,28,110 . Na primeira, a rivaroxabana em dose terapêutica (20 mg/dia) demonstrou superioridade em eficácia quando comparada ao placebo, porém com mais eventos de sangramento (sem diferença em sangramento maior). Um segundo estudo de três grupos comparou duas doses distintas de rivaroxabana (10 e 20 mg/dia) versus AAS 100 mg/ dia. As duas doses de rivaroxabana apresentaram eficácia similar entre si na prevenção da recorrência de TEV, sendo ambas superiores ao AAS. Não houve diferença de sangramento entre os grupos. Um estudo foi dedicado para determinar a eficácia e segurança da apixabana na redução da recorrência do TEV. Duas doses de apixabana (2,5 e 5,0 mg de 12 em 12 horas) foram comparados a placebo, ambas apresentando superioridade em eficácia e não inferioridade em segurança 111 . É importante mencionar que pacientes com alto risco de sangramento eram sistematicamente excluídos dos estudos supracitados. Dose e escolha do agente antitrombótico Embora a varfarina e o AAS tenham demonstrado superioridade sobre o placebo na prevenção de recorrência do TEV, estudos posteriores demonstraram a superioridade dos DOACs para tal finalidade. Dessa forma, AVKs e AAS devem ser usados para tal propósito apenas em situações em que os DOACs estão contraindicados, como, por exemplo, na SAF 112 . Em único estudo comparativo entre a varfarina e a rivaroxabana em portadores de SAF triplo positivo, a varfarina demonstrou superioridade no desfecho combinado de eficácia e segurança, sendo a droga de escolha para esse grupo de pacientes 113 . No entanto, não está claro se todos os pacientes devem receber doses reduzidas. Em pacientes com alto risco de recorrência e baixo risco de sangramento, o uso de DOACs em dose plena parece ser a escolha adequada. Duração do tratamento estendido do TEV Não há uma definição rígida da duração ideal do tratamento estendido do TEV. Na maioria dos ensaios clínicos que investigaram tal estratégia, a duração foi de 1 a 2 anos, com poucos ultrapassando os 36 meses. Porém, para pacientes com TEV recorrente sem fatores de risco identificáveis ou persistentes, recomenda-se a anticoagulação por tempo indeterminado 103 . O termo “anticoagulação perene” deve ser evitado, uma vez que a manutenção da terapia anticoagulante deve ser periodicamente reavaliada, considerando o equilíbrio entre o risco para recorrência do TEV e o risco de sangramentos. Tratamento intervencionista no TEV agudo Filtro de VCI O uso de filtros de VCI tem sido associado a inúmeras controvérsias nos últimos anos. Há relatos de uso Tabela 10.

Deve-se notar que o único objetivo dos filtros VCI é prevenir a EP e, portanto, reduzir a sua morbimortalidade. No entanto, os filtros VCI são a única opção de tratamento viável para pacientes TVP onde a anticoagulação é contraindicada, embora estudos randomizados sejam necessários. No estudo Prevention du Risque d’Embolie Pulmonaire par Interruption Cave (PREPIC) 142 , 400 pacientes com TVP proximal, com ou sem EP sintomático concomitante, foram randomizados para filtro de VCI permanente ou sem filtro. O estudo empregou um fatorial dois a dois, e os pacientes também foram randomizados para HBPM SC (enoxaparina) ou HNF IV (visando a uma relação TTPA de 1,5 e 2,5). Todos os pacientes foram submetidos a varreduras de perfusão/ventilação inicial e de acompanhamento quando os sintomas de potencial EP ocorreram, ou entre 8 e 12 dias para avaliar a EP assintomática. O desfecho primário foi a ocorrência de EP (sintomática ou assintomática) dentro de 12 dias após a randomização. Uma variedade de resultados secundários baseados em sintomas também foi avaliada. No dia 12, EP sintomática ou assintomática ocorreu em apenas dois pacientes (1,1%) no grupo de filtro versus nove pacientes (4,8%) no grupo sem filtro. Até 2 anos, houve seis eventos de EP no grupo com filtro (um óbito) e 12 no grupo sem filtro (cinco óbitos; OR 0,5; IC95% 0,19-1,33, p=0,16), mas TVP recorrente ocorreu em 37 pacientes (20,8%) no grupo de filtro versus 21 pacientes (11,6%) designados para nenhum filtro (OR 1,87; IC95% 1,1-3,2; p=0,02). As taxas de mortalidade foram semelhantes nos dois grupos em 2 anos (43 pacientes versus 40 pacientes nos grupos com filtro e sem filtro, respectivamente). Os resultados de 8 anos foram publicados em 2005 e mostraram que a EP sintomática ocorreu em nove pacientes (6%) no grupo com filtro versus 24 (15%) no grupo sem filtro (p = 0,008). No entanto, TVP recorrente foi mais comum no grupo com filtro (57 pacientes versus 41 pacientes; p=0,042). Os autores concluíram que, apesar da redução do risco de EP, o aumento do risco de TVP recorrente e a falta de benefício na sobrevida significam que o uso sistemático de filtros IVC não pode ser recomendado para essa população. No estudo PREPIC 2 144 , publicado em 2015, randomizado e prospectivo, foram analisados 399 pacientes com EP e TVP sintomáticas. O grupo de implante de filtro de VCI removível foi constituído por pacientes que apresentavam pelo menos um critério de gravidade, isso é, maiores de 75 anos, câncer ativo, insuficiência cardíaca ou respiratória crônica, acidente vascular cerebral isquêmico com paralisia da perna nos últimos 6 meses (mais de 3 dias antes da randomização), TVP envolvendo o segmento iliocava ou bilateral, ou pelo menos um sinal de disfunção ventricular direita ou lesão miocárdica (n = 200) e grupo apenas anticoagulação (n = 199). Os dois grupos, com e sem filtro, foram anticoagulados por 6 meses, e se planejou a remoção do filtro em 3 meses. O filtro foi inserido com sucesso em 193 pacientes, e foi recuperado conforme planejado em 153 dos 164 pacientes nos quais a recuperação foi tentada. Aos 3 meses, EP recorrente ocorreu em seis pacientes (3,0%; todos fatais) no grupo do filtro, e em três pacientes (1,5%; 2 fatais) no grupo controle (risco relativo com filtro, 2,00 [IC95% 0,51-7,89]; p = 0,50). Os resultados foram semelhantes aos 6 meses. Nenhuma diferença foi observada entre os dois grupos em relação aos outros resultados. A trombose do filtro ocorreu em três pacientes. Conclui-se que entre os pacientes hospitalizados com EP aguda grave, o uso de um filtro de VCI removível associado à anticoagulação, em comparação com a anticoagulação isolada, não reduziu o risco de EP sintomática recorrente em 3 meses. Esses achados não suportam o uso desse tipo de filtro em pacientes que podem ser tratados com anticoagulação. No estudo Filter Implantation to Lower Thromboembolic Risk in Percutaneous Endovenous Intervention (FILTER-PEVI)145, 141 pacientes submetidos à remoção precoce de trombos foram randomizados para filtro VCI ou sem filtro. Pacientes com e sem EP na apresentação foram incluídos. Apenas pacientes sintomáticos foram investigados e EP foram identificados em um paciente no grupo de filtro, em comparação com oito no grupo sem filtro. No entanto, não houve diferença na mortalidade e o estudo foi enfraquecido pela falta de imagens pré- operatórias das artérias pulmonares. A contraindicação absoluta para anticoagulação inclui sangramento ativo incontrolável, alto risco de sangramento maior (por exemplo, defeito de coagulação, trombocitopenia grave, hemorragia intracerebral recente ou lesão cerebral com alto risco de sangramento) ou cirurgia urgente que exija interrupção da anticoagulação 143 . Parece haver consenso com evidência de boa qualidade para que a anticoagulação não seja usada concomitantemente ao implante do filtro de VCI, assim como em casos de contraindicação temporária à anticoagulação, em pacientes com filtro já implantado, este seja reiniciada tão logo o risco de sangramento esteja resolvido 11,54,84,144 .

Classe II nível B 143,145,146 Tratamento intervencionista do TEV agudo – trombólise, trombectomia farmacomecanica Existem muitos trabalhos publicados sobre o tratamento intervencionista do TEV agudo, mas somente quatro trabalhos prospectivos randomizados têm melhor peso para análise dos resultados: CaVenT, ATTRACT, ATTRACT (Fase III) e CAVA 147-153 . O estudo CaVenT comparou trombólise direta por cateter (TDC) adjuvante com rtPA, além do tratamento anticoagulante com tratamento anticoagulante isolado seguido por anticoagulantes orais continuados em dois grupos por pelo menos 6 meses. O resultado primário de eficácia foi a presença de SPT, definido como uma pontuação ≥ 5 na escala de Villalta no membro acometido ou úlcera nessa perna na consulta de 24 meses. O estudo demonstrou uma redução significativa no SPT no grupo de intervenção, com uma redução de risco absoluto de 14,4% em 24 meses 147-149 . Os resultados de acompanhamento a longo prazo do estudo CaVenT demonstraram que a redução de risco absoluto aumentou para 28% após 5 anos. O número necessário para tratar diminuiu de sete para quatro 147 , sendo que nenhuma diferença na qualidade de vida foi detectada, mas o estudo não considerava esse desfecho. Foi evidenciada uma piora significativa na qualidade de vida para pacientes que desenvolveram SPT em toda a população do estudo 148 . Além disso, uma análise de custo-efetividade demonstrou um benefício líquido do tratamento, com um incremento na taxa de custo-efetividade de US$ 20.000 na qualidade de vida, ajustado por ano/vida 150 . O estudo ATTRACT é um estudo prospectivo randomizado multicêntrico para avaliar trombectomia farmacomecânica (TFM) e TDC para a prevenção de SPT em pacientes com TVP femoral ou mais proximal em comparação com a terapia padrão com anticoagulantes orais isoladamente 151 . O protocolo usou três modalidades diferentes (TDC isolado ou combinado com TFM usando Angiojet®/Trellis-8 ® ) nos pacientes randomizados para o grupo de tratamento, a critério do médico assistente. O resultado de eficácia primária foi semelhante ao do estudo CaVenT, ou seja, a presença de SPT, definida como uma pontuação ≥5 na escala de Villalta no membro acometido ou uma úlcera, ocorrendo a qualquer momento desde a visita de acompanhamento pós-randomização de 6 meses até a visita de 24 meses (inclusive). Ao longo de 24 meses, não houve diferença na proporção de pacientes que desenvolveram SPT entre os dois grupos de tratamento (47% com TDC/TFM versus 48% com terapia padrão; RR 0,96; IC95% 0,82-1,11; p = 0,56). TFM levou a mais sangramentos graves em 10 dias (1,7% TFM versus 0,3% terapia padrão; p = 0,049) e nenhuma diferença em TEV recorrente em 24 meses (12,5% TFM versus 8,5% terapia padrão; p = 0,087). A intervenção reduziu a dor e o edema nas pernas até 30 dias, mas não melhorou significativamente a qualidade de vida desde o início do tratamento até 24 meses. A intervenção reduziu significativamente os escores de gravidade de SPT e reduziu significativamente o desenvolvimento de SPT moderado a grave (18% com SPT versus 24% com terapia padrão; RR 0,73; IC95% 0,54-0,98; p = 0,035) ao longo de 24 meses de seguimento. Já o estudo ATTRACT (Fase III) 15 2 foi um ensaio clínico randomizado de Fase III, multicêntrico, aberto, cego para avaliadores. Foi utilizado o Angiojet ® para TFM, e, em casos em que o trombo se estendia mais distal à poplítea, poderia-se realizar previamente TDC, e posteriormente TFM. Evidenciou-se que na TVP poplíteo-femoral, exceto pela redução do SPT aos 6 meses de acompanhamento (21,7% com TFM versus 40,8% com controle; p=0,01), não foram identificadas diferenças significativas nos resultados iniciais ou tardios do estudo entre o TFM e do braço de controle dos pacientes. Na TVP fêmoro-ilíaca, a SPT foi em 41 (43,2%) de 95 pacientes tratados com TFM e 40 (40,0%) de 100 pacientes do braço de controle (p = 0,65) em 24 meses. As estimativas da escala de Villalta e dos escores VCSS de 6 a 24 meses e das proporções de pacientes com SPT em 6 meses (26,2% versus 39,2%; p = 0,08) foram nominalmente menores para TFM do que para controle, mas as diferenças não foram estatisticamente significantes e nem foram observadas diferenças nas ocorrências de 2 anos de SPT moderada ou grave, SPT grave, ulceração venosa ou QOL de 6 a 24 meses. A melhora na gravidade da doença inicial foi maior para a TFM do que para o controle, alcançando significância estatística em 30 dias (diferença média de 0,84 pontos na escala Likert; p = 0,0061). Da linha de base até 30 dias, os tratados por TFM tiveram melhora na qualidade de vida (diferença de 12,6 pontos da escala VEINES-QOL; p=0,0001) e sintomas (diferença de 11,4 pontos da escala VEINES-Sym; p=0,0003) do que os pacientes do braço de controle. Aos 30 dias, os tratados por TFM também apresentaram menos trombo residual. Em relação a complicações, sangramento maior, EP, insuficiência renal e bradicardia foram pouco",

O ensaio clínico CAVA é um estudo prospectivo, randomizado, multicêntrico, comparando o uso de trombólise acelerada por ultrassom versus apenas terapia de anticoagulação padrão 153 . Em contraste com o ATTRACT, este estudo envolveu apenas TVP fêmoro- ilíaco, abordando assim uma das críticas levantadas sobre os critérios de inclusão do estudo ATTRACT. No geral, o CAVA randomizou 184 pacientes: 91 para intervenção e 93 para terapia padrão, com 77 recebendo terapia e 75 permanecendo no grupo de terapia padrão após falha na triagem/retirada do consentimento. Após 12 meses de acompanhamento, o estudo não mostrou diferença entre os dois grupos de tratamento, com 22 de 77 (29%) daqueles submetidos à intervenção versus 26 de 75 (35%) daqueles em terapia padrão desenvolvendo SPT (p = 0,42). Esses dados levaram à conclusão de que, para pacientes com TVP proximal aguda, a TFM não impediu a SPT, mas aumentou o sangramento maior. Os resultados sugeriram que pode haver um benefício na redução do risco de SPT moderada a grave, embora ainda houvesse uma taxa de SPT maior do que a esperada em pacientes tratados com remoção precoce do trombo 153 . No entanto, nenhum benefício foi observado em pacientes com TVP poplítea-femoral 154 . Em uma revisão sistemática publicada na Cochrane 155 , comparando estratégia trombolíticos versus anticoagulação para TVP de membro inferior, observou-se que aqueles que receberam trombólise tiveram mais complicações hemorrágicas (6,7% versus 2,2%) (RR 2,45; IC95% 1,58-3,78; 1.943 participantes, 19 estudos; evidência de qualidade moderada). Nenhuma diferença entre as estratégias foi detectada pela análise de subgrupo (p = 0,25). Até 5 anos após o tratamento, ocorreu um número ligeiramente menor de casos de SPT naqueles que receberam trombólise, 50% em comparação com 53% na anticoagulação padrão (RR 0,78; IC95% 0,66-0,93; 1.393 participantes, seis estudos; evidência de qualidade moderada). Isso ainda foi observado no acompanhamento tardio (além de 5 anos) em dois estudos (RR 0,56; IC95% 0,43-0,73; 211 participantes; evidência de qualidade moderada). Usando a análise de subgrupo para investigar se o nível de TVP (fêmoro-ilíaca, poplítea-femoral ou não especificado) teve efeito sobre a incidência de SPT, não foi observado nenhum benefício da trombólise independente do nível da TVP (seis estudos; teste para diferenças de subgrupo: p = 0,29). Trombólise sistêmica e TDC tiveram níveis semelhantes de eficácia. Estudos de TDC incluíram quatro ensaios em TVP femoral e fêmoro-ilíaca, e os resultados são consistentes com aqueles de ensaios de trombólise sistêmica em TVP em outros níveis de oclusão.

Classe I nível B 147-153 . COVID E TEV TEV relacionado à COVID-19 Epidemiologia O risco aumentado de eventos tromboembólicos em pacientes com infecção pelo vírus SARS-CoV-2 tem sido demonstrado por diversos estudos 156-160 , assim como maior mortalidade quando esses eventos estão associados, tornando necessária sua suspeição principalmente nos pacientes com infecção moderada a grave, internados em enfermarias ou em unidades de terapia intensiva. Os eventos trombóticos no território venoso e suas consequências, que incluem as TVP e EP, são mais prevalentes em pacientes hospitalizados de uma forma geral, principalmente em unidades de terapia intensiva 161 , sendo que a incidência de TEV em pacientes hospitalizados sem tromboprofilaxia é de 14,9% 161,162 . Nos pacientes com quadro de COVID-19 com necessidade de hospitalização, a TEV, segundo metanálise publicada no Chest Journal em 2021, foi de 17%, EP, 7,1% e TVP, 12,1% 163 . Em outra recente metan á lise, a prevalência de TVP e EP em pacientes hospitalizados com diagnóstico de COVID-19 foi ainda maior (14,8% e 16,5%, respectivamente) 164 . Diagnóstico Exames laboratoriais A dosagem de DD encontra-se aumentada na maioria dos pacientes com infecção pelo SARS- CoV-2 mesmo sem quadro de TEV, porém alguns estudos demonstraram níveis de DD ainda maiores nos pacientes com COVID 19 associada à TVP e EP 165-167 .",

J Vasc Bras. 2024;23:e20230107. https://doi.org/10.1590/1677-5449.202301071 Demelo-Rodríguez et al. 16 7 relataram que um ponto de corte de dosagem de DD de 1,57 (μg/ml) possui sensibilidade de 95,7% e especificidade de 29,3%, valor preditivo positivo de 19% e valor preditivo negativo de 97,5% para diagnóstico de TVP assintomática nos pacientes com COVID-19. DD elevado também foi considerado como preditor de gravidade 168,169 . Tratamento Os princípios do tratamento do TEV em pacientes com COVID-19 não diferem em relação aos pacientes com TEV não COVID 170 . Recomenda-se uso de anticoagulantes parenterais como terapia inicial (HNF e HBPM), especialmente nos pacientes internados, podendo realizar a transição para anticoagulantes orais (DOACs ou AVKs) após estabilização clínica 171 . Os DOACs têm sido a terapêutica preferencial na transição do regime parenteral para o regime oral, por apresentar menores taxas de sangramento do que a varfarina. Os inibidores do fator Xa, como a rivaroxabana e apixabana, têm sido os mais utilizados no tratamento do TEV em pacientes com COVID-19 após a alta hospitalar e estabilização do quadro clínico dos pacientes. A duração do tratamento dependerá da persistência ou não de fatores de risco, além de doenças concomitantes que necessitem de anticoagulação plena, porém deve ser considerada por no mínimo 3 meses 172 . Anticoagulação em pacientes com COVID-19 sem evidência de TEV Esse assunto tem suscitado muitas dúvidas e estudos discrepantes na literatura. Não resta dúvida de que os pacientes com COVID-19 com evidências de TEV devem ser submetidos à anticoagulação em regime terapêutico habitual, o mesmo que seria administrada aos pacientes sem COVID-19. O cerne da questão é qual tipo de regime anticoagulante deve ser administrado nos pacientes com COVID-19 sem evidências de fenômenos trombóticos. Recentemente, duas publicações avaliaram os regimes de anticoagulação terapêutico e profilático em dois tipos de pacientes: os pacientes graves, submetidos à intubação orotraqueal, e os pacientes com COVID-19 moderado, internados, mas sem necessidade de oxigenioterapia suplementar. O primeiro estudo avaliou os tipos de anticoagulação nos pacientes graves, já submetidos à intubação orotraqueal, internados em UTI. Foram avaliados 1.098 pacientes: um grupo de pacientes submetido à terapia com HNF ou enoxaparina em dose terapêutica, e o outro grupo de pacientes submetido à enoxaparina ou HNF em dose profilática. Os resultados do estudo demonstraram que a sobrevida hospitalar nos pacientes em regime terapêutico foi de 62,7% versus 64,5% no grupo de pacientes submetidos ao regime profilático, sem diferença estatística entre os grupos. A taxa de hemorragia importante, entretanto, foi maior no grupo submetido à anticoagulação terapêutica no grupo profilático (3,8% versus 2,3%). Os autores concluíram que não houve diferença em relação à mortalidade nos pacientes graves submetidos aos tratamentos terapêutico ou profilático com anticoagulação, porém houve maior taxa de sangramento no grupo de pacientes submetidos à anticoagulação plena 173 . O estudo INSPIRATION, que avaliou 600 pacientes internados em unidade de terapia intensiva (UTI), randomizados para tratamento com anticoagulação plena versus profilática, não encontrou benefícios do uso da anticoagulação terapêutica na prevenção de mortalidade, fenômenos tromboembólicos e uso de ECMO (HR 1,06; IC95% 0,83-1,36) 174 . Outro estudo teve como escopo a avaliação entre os regimes terapêuticos de anticoagulação plena versus profilático com enoxaparina ou HNF em pacientes internados com COVID-19 moderada, sem lesão ou insuficiência de órgão alvo e sem necessidade de oxigenioterapia suplementar. Entre 2.219 pacientes na análise final, a probabilidade de que a anticoagulação de dose terapêutica aumentou o suporte de órgão – livre em dias –, em comparação com a tromboprofilaxia de tratamento usual, foi de 98,6%. A probabilidade final da superioridade da dose terapêutica de anticoagulação em relação à tromboprofilaxia de tratamento usual foi de 97,3% em pacientes com DD alto, 92,9% em pacientes com DD baixo e 97,3% em pacientes com DD desconhecido. Sangramento importante ocorreu em 1,9% dos pacientes que receberam dose terapêutica de anticoagulação, e em 0,9% dos que receberam tromboprofilaxia. Os autores concluíram que a anticoagulação plena com enoxaparina ou HNF em pacientes com COVID-19 moderada aumentou a probabilidade de sobrevida hospitalar, com menor incidência de insuficiência orgânica multisistêmica, ou seja, insuficiência renal, cardiovascular e respiratória 172,173 . Da mesma forma, o estudo HEP-COVID avaliou 253 pacientes com COVID-19 e níveis elevados de DD, randomizando-os para doses terapêutica e profilática de anticoagulantes. Os desfechos primários (óbito, TEV e trombose arterial) foram maiores no grupo que recebeu anticoagulante profilático (42%) do que no grupo de pacientes que recebeu anticoagulação plena (29%) (RR 0,68; IC95% 0,49-0,96; p = 0,03) 175 . Esse benefício só foi observado em pacientes que se encontravam em leito de enfermaria. Pacientes internados em UTI não foram beneficiados com a anticoagulação plena. De maneira geral, com base na literatura, em pacientes críticos, internados em UTI com COVID-19, é recomendado o uso de anticoagulantes na dose profilática (enoxaparina 40 mg, SC, dose única diária). Já os pacientes internados com COVID-19 em regime de enfermaria, é recomendada a administração de",

J Vasc Bras. 2024;23:e20230107. https://doi.org/10.1590/1677-5449.202301071 doses terapêuticas de anticoagulantes (rivaroxabana 20 mg/dia ou enoxaparina 1 mg/kg/dose, SC, de 12 em 12 horas). Por sua vez, pacientes internados por outras condições clínicas, nos quais o COVID-19 é descoberto incidentalmente, a dose profilática de anticoagulante já é suficiente, sendo recomendada pela literatura em geral. Um potencial benefício de se manter anticoagulante em doses profiláticas após a alta hospitalar de pacientes com COVID-19, com alto risco de TEV, foi demonstrado no estudo MICHELLE 176 , o qual avaliou 320 pacientes com COVID-19 internados com alto risco de desenvolver TEV, mas sem nenhuma evidência de TEV documentada até o momento de alta, randomizados para receber rivaroxabana na dose de 10 mg e nenhum anticoagulante por 35 dias após a alta hospitalar. A incidência de complicações (TEV, tromboembolismo arterial ou evento cardiovascular) foi maior no grupo de pacientes que não recebeu anticoagulante (9%) do que no grupo que recebeu a dose profilática de rivaroxabana (3%) (RR 0,33; IC95% 0,12-0,90). Apesar desses dados robustos, essa é uma coorte pequena, portanto ainda não existe consenso na literatura acerca da recomendação de rotina de anticoagulantes em dose profilática para pacientes com alto risco de TEV que receberam alta hospitalar devido à COVID-19, sendo recomendado avaliar caso a caso, pesando o risco-benefício de cada paciente, enquanto se aguardam novos estudos na literatura. Um outro estudo, que acompanhou ambulatorialmente 4.906 pacientes internados com COVID-19 que receberam alta hospitalar, evidenciou uma incidência de TEV de 1,6% pós-alta, sendo que farmacoprofilaxia para TEV só foi utilizada em 13% da amostra. A incidência de TEV foi menor nos pacientes que não receberam anticoagulantes do que nos pacientes submetidos a farmacoprofilaxia para TEV, na amostra desse estudo. A taxa de sangramentos maiores com uso de anticoagulantes foi de 1,7%, sendo maior que o risco de TEV 177 . A maior parte dos pacientes com COVID-19 são tratados ambulatorialmente, sem necessidade de internação hospitalar. Para esses pacientes, não é indicada farmacoprofilaxia para TEV, a menos que o paciente apresente outros fatores associados que necessitem o uso de anticoagulantes, como TEV já documentada atual, fibrilação atrial, câncer em atividade ou trombofilias hereditárias que exibam alto risco de TEV, tais quais deficiência da antitrombina, deficiência de proteína C, entre outras. Cada paciente deve ser avaliado individualmente, pesando-se o risco-benefício do uso de anticoagulantes como farmacoprofilaxia para TEV, nos pacientes com COVID-19, tratados ambulatorialmente, sem necessidade de internação. Em resumo: o tratamento da TEV em pacientes com COVID-19 segue princípios semelhantes ao tratamento de TEV sem relação com o COVID-19. Inicialmente, recomenda-se o uso de anticoagulantes parenterais (HNF e HBPM) em pacientes hospitalizados, podendo transitar para anticoagulantes orais (DOACs ou AVKs) após a estabilização clínica. Os DOACs, como rivaroxabana e apixabana, têm sido preferenciais devido a menores taxas de sangramento em comparação com a varfarina. Portanto, a decisão de aplicar a farmacoprofilaxia para TEV pós-alta deev ser personalizada, considerando o risco-benefício. Em pacientes ambulatorais, a profilaxia não é recomendada sistematicamente, exceto na presença de fatores de risco e devendo se levar em conta a chance de sangramento, assim como outras condições clínicas do paciente. Recomendação 21 Em eventos tromboembólicos agudos de pacientes infectados por COVID-19, recomendamos que a decisão da anticoagulação siga os mesmos princípios que os eventos que ocorram sem a concomitância da infecção viral. Classe II nível A 172-175 Recomendação 22 Em pacientes ambulatoriais infectados por COVID-19 e na ausência de outras condições clínicas que indiquem o uso de anticoagulantes, a administração desses medicamentos não é recomendada. Classe I nível B 172-175 Recomendação 23 Em pacientes de internação hospitalar pelo COVID-19, recomendamos categorizar o risco de evento tromboembólico venoso no pós-alta, antes de decidir pelo uso de anticoagulação ambulatorial.
