    "The Proposed 9th Edition TNM Classi fi cation of Lung Cancer Q1 Q22 Frank C. Detterbeck, MD; Gavitt A. Woodard, MD; Anna S. Bader, MD; Sanja Dacic, MD, PhD; Michael J. Grant, MD; Henry S. Park, MD; and Lynn T. Tanoue, MD Q2 Q3 A universal nomenclature of the anatomic extent of lung cancer has been critical for individual patient care as well as research advances. As progress occurs, new details emerge that need to be included in a re fi ned system that aligns with contemporary clinical management issues. The 9th edition TNM classi fi cation of lung cancer, which is scheduled to take effect in January 2025, addresses this need. It is based on a large international database, multidisciplinary input, and extensive statistical analyses. Key features of the 9th edition include validation of the signi fi cant changes in the T component introduced in the 8th edition, subdivision of N2 after exploration of fundamentally different ways of categorizing the N component, and further subdivision of the M component. This has led to reordering of the TNM combinations included in stage groups, pri- marily involving stage groups IIA, IIB, IIIA, and IIIB. This article summarizes the analyses and revisions for the TNM classi fi cation of lung cancer to familiarize the broader medical community and facilitate implementation of the 9th edition system. CHEST 2024; - ( - ): - - - KEY WORDS: lung cancer; stage groups; TNM classi fi cation Q6 Stage classi fi cation is a cornerstone of managing patients with cancer by providing a universal, consistent nomenclature about the anatomic extent of disease. This enables reliable communication and promotes assessment of the applicability of clinical trial results to an individual patient ’ s tumor. TNM classi fi cation applies to a tumor (ie, the anatomic extent). The patient has many other characteristics that are explicitly not part of stage classi fi cation. TNM classi fi cation is not a prognostic model, as many patient-, setting-, and treatment- related factors also affect prognosis. Finally, treatment is not determined by the nomenclature of stage; this merely enables communication. Clinical studies de fi ne the role of treatment strategies; these are constantly evolving and include many factors besides anatomic tumor extent. A nomenclature must remain consistent and stable over time. Nevertheless, advances in imaging and treatment reveal new aspects to be clinically relevant.

    "periodically re fi ne the classi fi cation. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) periodically review, coordinate, and de fi ne new editions of TNM to maintain relevance and global consistency. Since 1996, in collaboration with AJCC and UICC, the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) has developed infrastructure to re fi ne successive editions of TNM. This involves an international multidisciplinary committee (the Staging and Prognostic Factors Committee [SPFC]), a large global database, and extensive statistical analysis (e-Fig 1). 1 The SPFC encompasses domains of thoracic malignancies (lung, thymic, mesothelioma, and esophageal), with multiple subcommittees focused on speci fi c aspects of TNM. The current article describes the SPFC proposals for the 9th edition TNM classi fi cation of lung cancer; these are being formally adopted by the AJCC and UICC and are slated to take effect on January 1, 2025. Methods TNM Structure The TNM system consists of three components: T for primary tumor extent, N for lymph node involvement, and M for distant metastases. Each T, N, and M compo- nent is divided into several categories (eg, T1, T2, and so forth) and subcategories (eg, T1a, T1b, and so forth). Various characteristics, known as descriptors, de fi ne what is included within a T, N, or M category. Combi- nations of T, N, and M categories are clustered together into stage groups. A pre fi x speci fi es the context of TNM classi fi cation (Table 1). Clinical stage (c) refers to the fi nal pretreat- ment stage (based on symptoms, physical signs, imaging, and biopsy results gathered within 4 months of diag- nosis). 2 Pathologic stage (p) is de fi ned according to the results of a surgical resection together with all clinical staging information (and, per AJCC, imaging deemed necessary following resection). Once established, the TNM classi fi cation is de fi nitive for the speci fi c context and must remain unchanged. The term presumptive or preliminary stage describes stage as it iteratively evolves during the process of patient evaluation. Unfortunately, the p-pre fi x is often loosely applied to T and N components with a different meaning, namely that biopsy material is available (without resection). AJCC/UICC restrict use of pT and pN to a surgical resection (with rare exceptions). 2,3 AJCC explicitly de- fi nes microscopic assessment of T and N during diag- nostic workup as cT and cN. 2 Rare exceptions when a pathologic designation is permitted without resection involve extensive tumors, are described differently by AJCC and UICC, and leave aspects unde fi ned or ambig- uous (e-Appendix 1). 2,3 Therefore, IASLC recommends that the p-pre fi x not be applied to individual compo- nents outside the context of surgical resection. 4 TABLE 1 ] Context of TNM Classi fi cation Q15 Pre fi x Name De fi nition c Clinical Prior to initiation of any treatment, using any and all information available (eg, physical examination, imaging, biopsy results) p Pathologic Following resection, based on pathologic assessment and all clinical information y Restaging After part or all of the treatment has been given, and can be used in a nonsurgical setting (ycTNM) or after resection (ypTNM) r Recurrence Stage at time of a recurrence a Autopsy Stage as determined by autopsy (cancer not suspected prior to death) Take-home Points Study Question: How is the 9th edition TNM clas- si fi cation of lung cancer different from the 8th edi- tion system? Results: N2 is subdivided into single- and multi- station N2, and M1c is subdivided into single- and multi-organ system M1c, resulting in a rearrange- ment of T and N categories included in the stage groups IIA, IIB, IIIA, and IIIB. Interpretation: A consistent nomenclature about anatomic extent of disease is fundamental to clear communication about clinical trial results and applicability to individual patients. 2 Special Features [ - # - C H E S T - 2 0 2 4 ] 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 REV 5.6.0 DTD  CHEST6248_proof  5 July 2024  9:51 pm  EO: CHEST-D-24-01050",
    "To communicate the type of testing involved in de fi ning the stage, the SPFC suggests an evaluation ( “ E ” ) catego- rization (Table 2), 4 applicable to either individual components or the overall stage. For the latter, the highest level of assessment used is applied to the entire stage (eg, T2bN2aM0 E3a if endobronchial ultrasound- transbronchial aspiration was used to de fi ne the N status). This assumes that managing clinicians used the highest level of evaluation for the component that was most critical in establishing the correct stage. The type of evaluation does not automatically de fi ne accu- racy; the need for additional tests varies, as do the per- formance characteristics of the tests in individual patients. Database A database of 124,581 patients diagnosed with lung can- cer from 2011 to 2019 was assembled, with follow-up through December 2021. 1 Following exclusions due to missing information and quality checks, 87,329 patients were available for analysis, with a focus on 73,421 with non-small cell lung cancer. Geographically, 56% came from Asia/Australia, 25% from Europe, 16% from North America, 3.4% from South/Central America, and 0.1% from Africa/Middle East. Individual analyses imposed speci fi c criteria; overall, for c- and p-stages, 58,193 and 39,192 cases were available for stage group analyses, 33,982 and 30,715 for T component analyses, 45,032 and 35,009 for N component analyses, and 14,937 (c-stage only) for M component analyses, respec- tively. 5-8 Separate con fi rmatory analyses of the proposed revisions were performed for small cell and carcinoid tu- mors of the lung. When the T category and stage group were determined by the primary tumor size, the 8th edition de fi nitions were used whenever available (ie, solid [c-stage] or inva- sive [p-stage] component size). The method on how size was measured was missing in approximately 50% of cases, however, re fl ecting that the 8th edition size mea- surement recommendations were published in 2016. 9 Cases with speci fi c solid/invasive size and those with an unspeci fi ed method of the size measurement were combined; separate analyses according to type of size measurement were deemed inappropriate due to con- founding by time period. However, secondary analyses comparing the overall cohort vs a cohort with solid/ invasive size measurements found similar ordering and discrimination. Analysis A formal methodology was followed to divide what is essentially a continuum into categories and groups. 10 Overall survival was used to re fl ect inherent biologic behavior, together with practical considerations and relevance in a contemporary clinical context. Because prognosis varies (eg, over time, according to region, setting, histotype), the SPFC required consistent ordering and discrimination across multi- ple tiers of subset analyses. Additional tests for within-group homogeneity, broad generalizability, and assessment of potential confounders were included as appropriate. To promote stability over time, changes were required to be based on strong evidence and to permit backward compatibility. Analyses involving < 50 patients and sur- vival differences < 5% were considered questionable due to poor ability to assess potential confounders or consis- tency among subgroup analyses. Although differences were generally required to be statistically signi fi cant, sample size and potential confounding were taken into account. Furthermore, the widespread acceptance alone of certain anatomic characteristics sometimes justi fi ed retention.

    "Results The TNM classi fi cation applies to primary lung carcinomas, including non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, and bronchopulmonary carcinoid tumors. It does not apply to pulmonary sarcomas or lymphomas. TNM Categories and Descriptors Potential revisions of the T, N, and M categories were explored by assessing consistency and generalizability of discrimination, as well as usefulness in the context of current clinical care strategies. Following discussions within each subcommittee and the entire SPFC, the de fi nitions shown in Table 3 7 were selected. This involved no changes to the T component, subdivision of N2 (into N2a with metastasis to a single station and N2b to multiple N2 stations), and subdivision of M1c (into M1c1 with multiple metastases in a single organ system and M1c2 involving multiple organ systems). T Categories: The T descriptors primarily involve increasing size, or increasing invasion peripherally (eg, visceral pleura, chest wall) or centrally (eg, main bronchus, carina). 6 When multiple T descriptors are applicable to a tumor, the highest T category is chosen. The size measurement is de fi ned by the largest dimension of the solid component (on imaging, c-stage) or the invasive component (on microscopy, p-stage). 9 The size of a ground-glass (GG) or lepidic component is not counted. The solid component size is measured on thin CT scan images ( # 1.5 mm) using lung windows, although mediastinal windows can be useful to evaluate changes in density over time. 11 Generally, axial images are suf fi cient, but multiplanar images can be used if deemed to better represent the largest tumor dimension. 11 If there are several solid components, the size of the largest solid portion is used. 9 Microscopically, the largest dimension of the invasive component is used; any adjacent spread through air spaces (STAS) is not counted. 9,12 Rarely, when pathologic measurement is problematic and deemed inaccurate, using the clinical measurement as the pT size is recommended. 3,9,13 A Pancoast tumor is classi fi ed as T3 if it involves thoracic (ie, T1 or T2) nerve roots, the stellate ganglion, or the chest wall (ribs or soft tissue). It is classi fi ed as T4 if it involves vertebral bodies, the spinal canal, subclavian vessels, cervical nerve roots, or components of the brachial plexus. 7 N Categories: Various potential revisions were considered, including a shift to the number of node stations, zones, and hybrid approaches. 5 The analyses supported maintaining the traditional categories by anatomic location but subdividing N2 into single vs multiple station involvement (Table 3). Speci fi cally, consistent ordering and discrimination were shown in multiple cohorts: R0, R-any, T1, T2, T3, and T4, and in pairwise comparisons of adjacent (sub)categories and by multivariable regression. Generalizability was veri fi ed across time periods, histotypes, geographic regions, source data types, and treatment approaches. 5 Consistent ordering and discrimination were seen in both c- and p-stage analyses (not previously feasible for p-stage). The 9th edition classi fi cation highlights the need for thorough clinical assessment and reporting, as well as thorough preoperative and intra-operative node evaluation. If no nodes are assessed, the NX designation applies. The data granularity was insuf fi cient to assess which imaging modalities or biopsy techniques were used or the thoroughness thereof. Nevertheless, the consistent survival differences observed in a large global database provide evidence of real-life applicability (although the analysis excluded cases without suf fi cient information about the number and sites of node involvement). The 9th edition N classi fi cation underscores the value of consistent de fi nitions of node stations. No changes are recommended to the lung cancer node map (Fig 1). M Categories: The M subcommittee explored several issues, including assessments of metastatic burden (size, number of lesions, and/or sites), impact of speci fi c metastatic sites, and a de fi nition of oligometastatic disease. 8 The distinction of M1a, M1b, and M1c remained consistent in the 9th edition database. The prognostic impact of a pleural effusion deemed to be malignant was similar regardless of whether it was cytologically proven (this does not include effusions believed to be benign). A size threshold for the largest metastasis could not be de fi ned with suf fi cient consistency. The impact of speci fi c metastatic sites (eg, brain, adrenal, bone) was also inconsistent. Investigation of permutations of the number of lesions and metastatic organ sites suggested that the most robust categorization involved four categories (Table 3): M1a (intrathoracic metastases), M1b (single extrathoracic metastasis), M1c1 (multiple metastases in a single organ system), and M1c2 (multiple metastases in multiple organ systems). 8 4 Special Features [ - # - C H E S T - 2 0 2 4 ] 331 332 333 334 335 336 337 338 339 340 341 342 343 344 345 346 347 348 349 350 351 352 353 354 355 356 357 358 359 360 361 362 363 364 365 366 367 368 369 370 371 372 373 374 375 376 377 378 379 380 381 382 383 384 385 386 387 388 389 390 391 392 393 394 395 396 397 398 399 400 401 402 403 404 405 406 407 408 409 410 411 412 413 414 415 416 417 418 419 420 421 422 423 424 425 426 427 428 429 430 431 432 433 434 435 436 437 438 439 440 REV 5.6.0 DTD  CHEST6248_proof  5 July 2024  9:51 pm  EO: CHEST-D-24-01050",

    "This was consistent in multivariable analysis and multiple subset analyses (eg, region, time period, performance status, surgical/nonsurgical management, histotype). An increasing number of metastases correlated with incrementally decreasing survival. 8 Multiple thresholds of dichotomization were statistically signi fi cant, but no in fl ection point emerged to de fi ne oligometastatic disease. Although some potential confounders were shown to have little impact (eg, metastatic site), others could not be adequately assessed (eg, comorbidities, treatment details). It was deemed better to view the number of metastases as a clinical consideration together with the feasibility of local treatment; arbitrary selection of a dichotomization threshold for stage categorization seems unjusti fi ed. 8 The M1c1 de fi nition should be applied to an organ system, regardless of whether the organ is solitary, paired, or diffuse throughout the body (eg, skeleton). The analysis performed of the available data re fl ects this de fi nition. It was not possible to de fi ne whether the M1c1 descriptor should include a limit to the number of metastases in one organ system. It is likely that this represents a continuum that is best left to clinical judgment in individual patients, rather than arbitrarily choosing a threshold. Separation of M1b and M1c1 was not fully investigated. These groups were not consistently distinct in all analyses; detailed investigation of potential reasons or confounders was not performed. It was deemed that distinguishing M1b and M1c1 should be maintained, based on lack of clear evidence to the contrary, the historical precedent, and a clinical consensus that views a solitary metastasis differently than multiple metastases. Similarly, in some subgroups, the separation of M1a and M1b was minimal. However, distinguishing these categories is maintained in the 9th edition for the same reasons. Stage Groups The new N and M subcategories mandated a new de fi nition of stage groups.

    "within-group homogeneity and between-group discrimination in overall survival. Additional considerations included alignment with evolving treatment strategies and ease of adoption of potential changes. Figure 2 compares the 8th edition stage groups vs the 9th edition schema that emerged as the best. 7 The new stage groups exhibit robust homogeneity in both the c stage and the p stage. 7 Multivariable regression revealed consistent ordering and discrimination, con fi rmed in the validation cohort and multiple subset analyses of generalizability (e-Figs 2-4). 7 The unadjusted pairwise comparisons of cIIIC vs cIVA were mostly not statistically signi fi cant; distinguishing these groups is nonetheless deemed appropriate because of the fundamental difference between M0 and M1. Other sporadic nonsigni fi cant unadjusted comparisons are attributable to limited sample sizes and potential confounders. Figure 3 shows that M0 tumors are coalesced into groups that largely lie along diagonals; higher stage groups consist of tumors with progressively higher T or higher N categories. Figure 4 schematically depicts the speci fi c TNM combinations included in the stage groups. The 5-year survival according to stage group is summarized in e-Tables 1 and 2; outcomes vary according to time period, region, and multiple other characteristics. 7,14,15 Conceptually, the biologic behavior of a locally invasive tumor (higher T/low N) seems different than that of a lower T tumor that has greater nodal dissemination (higher N). 16 However, the analysis exhibited general homogeneity in overall survival. Furthermore, it is unclear that the optimal therapy is fundamentally different for higher T/lower N tumors vs lower T/higher N tumors that are included in the same stage group. General Rules Regarding TNM Classi fi cation Primary tumor invasion into other structures (eg, phrenic nerve, aorta) counts to determine the T category.

    "extension of nodal involvement into a T structure (eg, nodal extension into the recurrent laryngeal nerve) does not count as T involvement. 2,3 If it is impossible to determine if invasion of hilar/mediastinal structures emanates from the primary tumor or involved lymph nodes, the invasion is counted in determining the T category. 7 Finally, in rare instances, the primary tumor may directly invade an extrathoracic organ (eg, liver); this is not classi fi ed as M1. 2,3 A general AJCC/UICC rule is that when uncertainty exists regarding which designation is appropriate, the lower of the categories or stage groups in question should be used. 2,3 Multiple Pulmonary Sites The SPFC did not undertake any changes to the classi fi cation of multiple pulmonary sites of lung cancer. This topic encompasses four entities that represent different disease processes with different biologic behavior (e-Fig 5, Table 4 17 ). It is crucial to distinguish these; criteria that de fi ne this are provided in e-Tables 3 to 6. 17-20 Synchronous second primary lung cancers are not rare. The clinical characteristics (ie, presentation, imaging) and biologic behavior (ie, outcomes, recurrence patterns) for each tumor are similar to that of single “ typical ” lung cancers (ie, solid, spiculated). 19 Most second primary lung cancers have the same histotype and may have similar biomarker patterns. This means histotype and biomarker patterns alone are not entirely reliable to classify two tumors as separate primary or related tumors; clinical information and imaging appearance are crucial components. Subsequent outcomes generally con fi rm a clinical assessment that two tumors are synchronous primary lung cancers. 19 Second primary lung cancers should be designated with a T, N, and M category for each tumor. Some patients with a solid primary lung cancer have one or more solid separate tumor nodule(s) of the same histotype. The mechanism by which they arise is unclear. These tumors are classi fi ed according to the location of the separate nodule relative to the index tumor (T3 for same-lobe, T4 for ipsilateral different lobe, and M1a for contralateral lobe) with a single N and M category. 18 However, when resected, outcomes are equally good for T3, T4, and M1a separate tumor nodules, only slightly lower than those of similar tumors without a separate tumor nodule. 18 Although distinguishing synchronous primary cancers and a separate tumor nodule can be dif fi cult, the same management is generally warranted (aggressive treatment of each lesion), and subsequent outcomes are also similar. The most common disease pattern involving multiple pulmonary sites is that of multiple GG nodules. This group has different demographic characteristics, excellent outcomes, and infrequent nodal or extrathoracic recurrences. 20 Most of these lesions do not progress over 5 to 10 years. 21,22 The T category of these GG/lepidic tumors is the solid/invasive size of the highest T lesion with multiplicity indicated by the number or “ m ” in parentheses and a collective N and M category for all [eg, T1a(m)N0M0]. This multifocal adenocarcinoma entity is readily recognized by imaging; a detailed histologic assessment of each GG/lepidic tumor nodule is unecessary. 20 A less common pattern of lung cancer appears radiologically similar to pneumonia (so-called “ pneumonic-type ” lung cancer). Extrathoracic involvement is infrequent, but prognosis is distinctly worse than for the other entities exhibiting multiple pulmonary sites of lung cancer. 20 Diffuse pneumonic- type lung cancers are designated by size, or, when size measurement is dif fi cult, T3 if in one lobe, T4 if involving multiple ipsilateral lobes, and M1a if involving both lungs with a single N and M category for all areas of involvement. Recently, lung cancer with air lucency (LCAL) has emerged as another pattern of disease with frequent multiple pulmonary sites of involvement. 23 Progression of LCAL is often indolent, but sometimes rapid T1 N0 N1 N2a N2b N3 IA IB IIA IIA IIB IIIA IIIB IIB IIIA IIIA IIIB IIIC IIIA IIIA IIIB IIIB IIIC IVA IVA IVA IVA IVA IVB IVB IVB IVB IVB IIB IIIA IIIB IIIB T2 T3 T4 M1a,b M1c1,2 print & web 4C = FPO print & web 4C = FPO print & web 4C = FPO Figure 3 – Grid of TNM categories included in stage groups in the 9th edition TNM classi fi cation of lung cancer. 8 Special Features [ - # - C H E S T - 2 0 2 4 ] 771 772 773 774 775 776 777 778 779 780 781 782 783 784 785 786 787 788 789 790 791 792 793 794 795 796 797 798 799 800 801 802 803 804 805 806 807 808 809 810 811 812 813 814 815 816 817 818 819 820 821 822 823 824 825 826 827 828 829 830 831 832 833 834 835 836 837 838 839 840 841 842 843 844 845 846 847 848 849 850 851 852 853 854 855 856 857 858 859 860 861 862 863 864 865 866 867 868 869 870 871 872 873 874 875 876 877 878 879 880 REV 5.6.0 DTD  CHEST6248_proof  5 July 2024  9:51 pm  EO: CHEST-D-24-01050",

    "acceleration occurs, especially when a solid component develops. Progression is associated with frequent nodal involvement and a poor prognosis. TNM classi fi cation of LCAL has not been of fi cially addressed. We suggest that TNM classi fi cation be done similar to multifocal GG/lepidic adenocarcinoma, with T de fi ned by the solid component of the largest lesion and (#/m) to indicate multiplicity, and a single N and M. Other Staging-Related De fi nitions R Status: The classi fi cation of resection completeness as R0 (complete), R1 (microscopically positive resection margin), and R2 (gross unresected tumor) is fi rmly embedded in the AJCC/UICC classi fi cation. Lung Q7 cancer also includes an uncertain category [R(un)], in which the presence of residual tumor or the prognostic implication is uncertain (e-Fig 6, Table 5). 4,24 Validation studies have con fi rmed progressively lower survival for R0 vs R(un) vs R1 vs R2 (R1 and R2 are sometimes less clearly distinct, perhaps due to R2 sample size). 24 Two uncertain category descriptors are labeled R0(un), involving negative margins but a limited lymph node evaluation or the highest node station assessed was positive. Multiple studies have shown that limited node assessment is associated with lower survival. 24 IASLC de fi nes a full assessment as six or more node stations, including the subcarinal and two or more other mediastinal stations and hilar/lobar stations. IASLC counts stations invasively assessed either preoperatively or intra-operatively, as well as a documented absence of nodes in a station. 4,24 Subdivision of the N2 category and the shift to sublobar resection highlight the importance of careful node assessment. The American Cancer Society 2020 Operative Standard calls for sampling of three or more mediastinal stations and one hilar station. 25 However, some data suggest that the bene fi t associated with more thorough node evaluation is not seen in small GG tumors. 26 The R(un) category also includes carcinoma in situ at the bronchial margin and when a pleural lavage was performed and its fi ndings were cytologically positive. 4,24 These are designated as R1 (as de fi ned by the UICC) 13 with the addition of (is þ ) and (cy þ ), respectively, to distinguish them from a standard positive margin or malignant pleural effusion. Pleural lavage has been studied extensively (a meta-analysis included 28 studies and > 20,000 patients), 27 but it is seldom practiced outside of Japan. Pleural lavage cytology is positive in approximately 5% of patients, which correlates consistently with lower survival and TABLE 4 ] Patterns of Disease of Patients With Multiple Pulmonary Sites of Lung Cancer Q18 Second Primary Lung Cancer Separate Tumor Nodule Multifocal GG/L Nodules Pneumonic-Type of Adenocarcinoma Imaging features Two or more distinct tumors with imaging characteristic of lung cancer (eg, spiculated) Typical lung cancer (eg, solid, spiculated) with separate solid nodule Multiple ground-glass or part-solid nodules Patchy areas of ground glass and consolidation Pathologic features Different histotype or different morphology by comprehensive histologic assessment Distinct lesions with the same morphology by comprehensive histologic assessment Adenocarcinomas with prominent lepidic component (typically varying degrees of adenocarcinoma in situ, MIA, LPA) Same histology throughout (most often invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma) TNM classi fi ca-tion Separate cTNM and pTNM for each cancer Location of separate nodule relative to primary site determines if T3, T4, or M1a; single N and M T based on highest T lesion with (#/m) indicating multiplicity; single N and M T based on size, or T3 if in single lobe, T4 or M1a if in different ipsilateral or contralateral lobes; single N and M Conceptual view Unrelated tumors Single tumor, with intrapulmonary metastasis Field cancerization leading to development of separate tumors Single tumor, diffuse pulmonary involvement AIS ¼ adenocarcinoma in situ; GG/L ¼ ground-glass/lepidic; LPA ¼ lepidic-predominant adenocarcinoma; MIA ¼ minimally invasive adenocarcinoma.

    "higher recurrence rates following adjustment for confounders. 24 However, pleural recurrence accounts for only approximately 30% of recurrences. A macroscopically complete resection in the face of a malignant pleural effusion or nodules is designated as an R1 resection. Although such patients generally do not undergo resection, in those who do, 5-year survival rates of approximately 20% are reported consistently. 24 When a resection involves several R descriptors, the highest applicable R category is used. IASLC recommends using the R classi fi cation only in the context of a surgical resection and not consider expansion to describe response to nonsurgical treatment modalities. 4,24 IASLC recommends applying the R classi fi cation to any site of resection (primary tumor, nodes, pleural nodules, or an extrathoracic metastasis). 4,24 The site of resection should be recorded (eg, R0 [thorax] or R0 [adrenal]). In addition, the R classi fi cation applies to a speci fi c surgical procedure, and it does not count tumor in another site that is to be addressed separately (perhaps with another treatment modality). Recording the site of resection (eg, R0 [thorax]) and the M category communicates the completeness of a speci fi c resection and acknowledges remaining tumor at another site. This approach can accommodate separate management steps, as well as a combination of treatment modalities, and can communicate the completeness of a speci fi c step, all of which are important aspects with the increasing use of de fi nitive local therapy for oligometastatic disease. Additional Histologic Descriptors: The TNM system includes several additional histologic descriptors; however, only visceral pleural invasion (VPI) affects stage classi fi cation. Both invasion through the pleural elastic layer (PL1) and extension to the visceral pleural surface (PL2) are counted as VPI. In the 8th and 9th edition analyses, VPI had prognostic impact in small tumors, justifying the T2 designation. 6,28 The 8th edition analysis also suggested a prognostic impact for VPI in each larger tumor category and a gradation between PL1 and PL2, but these observations do not affect the T category. The term STAS refers to a microscopic observation of tumor cells adjacent to a lung cancer (median, 1- 1.5 mm). 29-31 A detailed 9th edition analysis con fi rms that STAS is a consistent independent negative prognostic factor, regardless of histotype or resection extent. 12 Nevertheless, STAS does not affect tumor size measurement or the T category. Other histologic features include lymphatic invasion (L), vascular invasion (V), and lymphangitic carcinomatosis (Ly, which may be adjacent to the tumor, lobar, or more TABLE 5 ] Residual Tumor Following Surgical Resection Symbol Name Descriptor R0 No residual No identi fi able tumor remaining, negative surgical margins, adequate node assessment a and highest node station assessed is negative R0 (un) Uncertain residual Limited node assessment a Highest station assessed is positive R1 (un) R1 (is) carcinoma in situ at the bronchial margin R1 (cy þ ) pleural lavage performed with malignant cytology R1 Microscopic residual Microscopically positive surgical margins but no visible tumor remaining b Extranodal extension of an involved hilar or mediastinal node c Malignant pleural or pericardial nodules or effusion d R2 Gross residual Gross (visible or palpable) tumor remaining b Lack of resection of involved nodes RX Unknown Margin cannot be assessed (Reprinted with permission from Detterbeck et al. 24 ) a Recommended assessment is $ 6 node stations (including subcarinal and two other mediastinal stations). b Applies to any site of tumor resection (ie, primary tumor, involved nodes, resected pleural implants, resected extrathoracic metastasis). c Applies when identi fi ed microscopically, regardless of how the nodes are resected (individually, in fragments, en bloc packet of an entire node station), provided there is no gross tumor remaining. d This classi fi cation (R1) applies if a resection has been accomplished that meets criteria for R0 in a patient with a malignant pleural (or pericardial) effusion or resected nodules. chestjournal.org 11 1101 1102 1103 1104 1105 1106 1107 1108 1109 1110 1111 1112 1113 1114 1115 1116 1117 1118 1119 1120 1121 1122 1123 1124 1125 1126 1127 1128 1129 1130 1131 1132 1133 1134 1135 1136 1137 1138 1139 1140 1141 1142 1143 1144 1145 1146 1147 1148 1149 1150 1151 1152 1153 1154 1155 1156 1157 1158 1159 1160 1161 1162 1163 1164 1165 1166 1167 1168 1169 1170 1171 1172 1173 1174 1175 1176 1177 1178 1179 1180 1181 1182 1183 1184 1185 1186 1187 1188 1189 1190 1191 1192 1193 1194 1195 1196 1197 1198 1199 1200 1201 1202 1203 1204 1205 1206 1207 1208 1209 1210 REV 5.6.0 DTD  CHEST6248_proof  5 July 2024  9:51 pm  EO: CHEST-D-24-01050",

Micrometastases are counted toward N and M categories with the additional symbol (mi) [eg, N2(mi)]. 2,4,32 Isolated tumor cells are isolated cells or small clumps of tumor cells # 0.2 mm, mostly only detected using special techniques. Isolated tumor cells do not count toward the N or M categories, 2,4 and their prognostic signi fi cance is unclear. Circulating tumor cells (isolated tumor cells in blood, typically detected by special staining techniques) are denoted as cM0(i þ ); they do not affect the TNM designation. Other blood-based assessments, such as cell-free tumor DNA, are not included in the TNM system. Discussion The 7th edition TNM classi fi cation of lung cancer was dramatically different by involving a database 20 times larger than ever before, an international multidisciplinary team, and extensive statistical analyses. 33 Nevertheless, changes were relatively minor, consisting primarily of adding three size thresholds to the T component. The 8th edition involved a similarly large database, team, and analysis, this time resulting in a major overhaul of the T component, subdividing in 1 cm increments and reallocating many descriptors. 34 The N component remained unchanged in both of these revisions. In the 9th edition, the T component is minimally re fi ned, but the N component is signi fi cantly altered. The general evolution of awareness and detailed node assessment has allowed relevant subcategories to emerge that affect clinical management. Increased data granularity permitted exploration of fundamentally different approaches to the N component, including the fi nal proposal to subdivide N2 into N2a and N2b. In addition, this led to classi fi cation of T1N2aM0 as stage IIB (instead of IIIA as in the 8th edition). The M component was divided into M1a and M1b in the 7 th edition; M1a, M1b, and M1c in the 8th edition; and now M1a, M1b, M1c1, and M1c2 in the 9th edition. A larger cohort of M1 tumors in the 9th edition allowed exploration of several aspects, including a de fi nition of oligometastatic disease appropriate for aggressive local therapy. The analysis shows that oligometastatic burden is a continuum without a clear in fl ection threshold, best left as a matter of clinical trials and judgment. The fi eld of lung cancer has evolved signi fi cantly. Effective treatment was once largely limited to surgical resection and early-stage tumors. All treatment modalities have advanced, and multimodality treatment is increasingly used across the spectrum of tumor extent: systemic therapy in early stage and local therapy in advanced stages. This creates an increased focus on anatomic tumor extent in advanced stages (ie, higher N and M categories). Although anatomic characteristics are instrumental for local therapies, nonanatomic tumor-related factors are important for systemic therapies (eg, presence/absence of driver mutations, PD-L1 expression). Such factors are already used in individual patient care. However, a system is needed that organizes nonanatomic factors, thereby providing a structure for databases, analysis, and communication, similar to what TNM has provided for anatomic factors. Challenges in developing this include the rapidity of advances, the mixture of prognostic and predictive factors, and multiplicity of lines of treatment. A classi fi cation system for nonanatomic tumor-related factors that complements TNM would be a component of a prognostic model. An accurate prognostic model would need to account for the impact of many additional patient-, setting-, and treatment-related factors. We need to clarify what would be most useful: a model for a large group or individualized patient- speci fi c prediction (as well as determining which outcome to address). Inherent challenges in developing a model include: predictions based on past data do not include present-day advances, re-validation is needed whenever new factors are added, and uncertainty (eg, random events) cannot be eliminated (furthermore, the more individualized the prediction, the greater the uncertainty). The TNM classi fi cation cannot be expected to appropriately address the complexity of nonanatomic tumor-related factors or to be a comprehensive prognostic model. Efforts to meet these needs are ongoing. TNM is purely a classi fi cation of anatomic tumor extent; this does not diminish the tremendous impact it has had over decades in facilitating care delivery and clinical research. What implications will the new TNM classi fi cation have on daily practice? It is important to recognize that 12 Special Features [ - # - C H E S T - 2 0 2 4 ] 1211 1212 1213 1214 1215 1216 1217 1218 1219 1220 1221 1222 1223 1224 1225 1226 1227 1228 1229 1230 1231 1232 1233 1234 1235 1236 1237 1238 1239 1240 1241 1242 1243 1244 1245 1246 1247 1248 1249 1250 1251 1252 1253 1254 1255 1256 1257 1258 1259 1260 1261 1262 1263 1264 1265 1266 1267 1268 1269 1270 1271 1272 1273 1274 1275 1276 1277 1278 1279 1280 1281 1282 1283 1284 1285 1286 1287 1288 1289 1290 1291 1292 1293 1294 1295 1296 1297 1298 1299 1300 1301 1302 1303 1304 1305 1306 1307 1308 1309 1310 1311 1312 1313 1314 1315 1316 1317 1318 1319 1320 REV 5.6.0 DTD  CHEST6248_proof  5 July 2024  9:51 pm  EO: CHEST-D-24-01050",
    "changing nomenclature (eg, IIB in the 9th vs IIIA in the 8th edition for T1N2aM0) does not change the data we have from clinical studies of outcomes and the effectiveness of speci fi c treatments. Furthermore, although the increased granularity of the 9th edition highlights the impact of details of tumor extent, the observations were observed fairly consistently in a global real-life collective of patients managed as deemed appropriate during the past decade. Further nuances of how to optimally manage patients will undoubtedly emerge from ongoing research, enhanced and stimulated by the granularity of the 9th edition TNM classi fi cation. Conclusions The process of re fi ning the 9th edition of the TNM classi fi cation of lung cancer is nearly complete; only formal adoption and implementation remain. The changes include clarifying details but most prominently involve subdivision of the N2 and M1c categories and reorganization of the TNM combinations included in stage groups IIA, IIB, IIIA, and IIIB. The current article also summarizes the extensive, multi-tiered analyses underlying these changes, which provide con fi dence in the consistency of discrimination and generalizability of the 9th edition classi fi cation. Changes in what is meant by the re-de fi ned stage groups mostly affects analyses of databases and large patient populations. At a TNM level (what is needed in individual care delivery), implementation should be straightforward because the changes are readily backward compatible. Changes in stage group nomenclature do not change the data we have about outcomes for patients with tumors of a particular T, N, and M extent. The universal language that TNM provides regarding anatomic extent has been made more granular, hopefully facilitating patient care. By circulating this summary of the analyses and de fi nitions of the 9th edition TNM classi fi cation of lung cancer, we hope to promote familiarity and ease the transition to implementation of the system in 2025.
