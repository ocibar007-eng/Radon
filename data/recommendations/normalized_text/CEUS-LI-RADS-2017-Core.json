    "LI-RADS ® v2017 CEUS Core 2 Overview Diagnostic Algorithm Last Viewed What is CEUS? Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS): • Advanced form of ultrasound (US) in which images are acquired: • using intravenously injected microbubble contrast agents. • with technology optimized for visualizing those agents. • Similar to CT and MRI, permits dynamic characterization of lesion and liver blood flow. • Allows characterization with high temporal resolution of limited number of observations. • Most suitable for problem solving. • Not optimal for staging entire liver. • Although it may be used with caution by expert practitioners in these contexts or for these purposes, it is not currently recommended by CEUS LI-RADS to: • characterize nodules occult on precontrast gray-scale images. • assess treatment response. CEUS LI-RADS is being developed for precontrast occult nodules and for treatment response. Key differences compared to CT and MRI are that CEUS: • Permits real-time imaging, which: • Virtually eliminates possibility of arterial phase mistiming. • May allow detection of APHE missed on CT or MRI. • Uses purely intravascular microbubble contrast agents, which affects washout and “capsule” characterization. • CEUS washout is true washout. Hence, CEUS uses the term washout, not the terms “washout” or washout appearance. • CEUS characterization of washout requires assessment of its onset (late vs. early) and degree (mild vs. marked), not just its presence. See page 14 & page 17 . • CEUS does not depict “capsule” (see page 24 ); “capsule” is not a CEUS major feature. • Is safer; microbubble agents have virtually no known adverse reactions. • Allows multiple injections of microbubble contrast agents in same examination, permitting more complete characterization of the same observation and/or assessment of additional observations. • Does not depict vascular pseudolesions such as arterioportal shunts, a frequent cause of diagnostic confusion on CT and MRI. • Any CEUS enhancing observation is a true lesion. • Has fewer ancillary features (AFs). See page 16 . • Permits characterization of limited number of targeted observations per examination; hence, not usually suitable for staging. • Requires higher level of expertise for optimal performance. • Is new in the United States, hence, not yet fully adopted or widely available. Indications for CEUS in patients at risk for HCC: • Assess nodules ≥ 10 mm detected on surveillance US. • Assess LR-3, LR-4, and LR-M observations detected on prior CT or MRI. • Detect APHE when mistiming is suspected as the reason for its absence on prior CT or MRI. • Assess biopsied observations with inconclusive histology. • Guide biopsy or treatment of observations difficult to visualize with precontrast US. • Help select appropriate observation(s) or observation component(s) for biopsy. • Monitor changes in enhancement pattern over time for selected CEUS LR-3 or CEUS LR-4 observations. • Differentiate tumor in vein (“tumor thrombus”) from bland thrombus.",

    "LI-RADS ® v2017 CEUS Core CEUS LI-RADS ® Technique: Considerations Before Performing a CEUS Exam Obtain proper training • Please see established guidelines from European Federation of Societies for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (EFSUMB) Minimum Training Requirements for the Practice of Medical Ultrasound in Europe. Appendix 14: Contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). Become acquainted with CEUS technical terminology and concepts Vascular phases and their typical timing • Arterial phase (AP): usually occurs from about 10-20 s to 30-45 s after contrast injection. • Portal venous phase (PVP): lasts from about 30-45 s to 2 min after contrast injection. • Late phase (LP): lasts from end of PVP until there is unequivocal clearance of microbubbles from the circulation at about 4-6 min. Continuous imaging – acquisition of images in real time, typically 10-20 frames/second. Provides real-time assessment of AP enhancement. Intermittent imaging – a series of brief image acquisitions, each lasting a few seconds and spaced about 30 seconds apart without any imaging in between. Helps reduce bubble destruction during assessment of washout. Recording – Saving cinematic loops and/or representative static images. Reinjection – Microbubbles may be reinjected in the same exam to permit more complete characterization of the same observation and/or assessment of additional observations. Become acquainted with CEUS dual-screen display and timing Use dual-screen display to demonstrate B-mode and contrast-mode images side by side. Place electronic calipers on observation on B-mode screen, using scanner software to automatically place calipers at same position on contrast-mode screen. Simultaneous display of calipers on both screens facilitates characterization of APHE and washout. Also, use scanner timer to record time after contrast injection on all images (required for characterizing washout).

    "LI-RADS ® v2017 CEUS Core CEUS LI-RADS ® Technique: CEUS LI-RADS ® Technical Recommendations Required systems and modes • Ultrasound scanner with contrast-specific imaging capability, including dual- screen and timer display. • Refer to contrast-specific instructions provided by scanner manufacturer. Contrast agents • Current version of CEUS LI-RADS applies to pure blood-pool agents but not to combined blood-pool/Kupffer cell agents such as Sonazoid®. • See page 8 for pure blood-pool agents available in your region. Imaging – Recommended • Precontrast – identify the following: • Target nodule(s). • Optimal patient position: supine, oblique, or left lateral decubitus. • Optimal scan plane: usually longitudinal (reduces out-of-plane resp. motion). • Optimal patient breathing: quiet or suspended (neutral, inspiration, expiration). • Arterial phase (AP): • Image continuously from contrast injection until peak AP enhancement to capture peak AP enhancement, characterize APHE, and determine presence of early washout. • Portal venous phase (PVP) to late phase (LP): • Image intermittently (every 30 s) to minimize microbubble destruction until microbubbles have cleared completely from the circulation (4-6 min) to detect late washout and assess its degree. Imaging – Suggested • Sweep liver in PVP or LP to identify additional nodules. These may manifest as focal hypoenhancing observations in liver. Recording – Recommended and optional • Record continuous cine loop from bubble arrival through peak APHE as a minimum requirement. Optionally the cine loop can be continued beyond the APHE peak until 60 seconds after injection. • Record static images at 60 seconds and with every intermittent (every ~30s) acquisition thereafter. Imaging parameters • Use low (< 0.3) mechanical index (MI) to avoid microbubble destruction. • Use default machine settings. Dual-screen imaging • Using B-mode image for guidance, place calipers on observation on both screens simultaneously to facilitate enhancement characterization. Timing • Begin timer after end of contrast injection, at beginning of saline flush (i.e, time 0 coincides with beginning of flush). • Record time in seconds at which washout is first detected. Injection technique • Use ≥ 20 G catheter. • Central venous lines and infusion ports are acceptable if safety and aseptic requirements are met. • Hand inject contrast over 2-3 seconds, maintaining constant syringe pressure. • Flush with 5-10 mL normal saline at about 2 ml/s. • Repeat injection as needed, per contrast manufacturer guidelines. • Do not exceed maximum total contrast dose listed in package insert. Diameter measurement • Use B-mode (precontrast). • Use same imaging mode and plane as prior exam to assess growth. 9 Technique Diagnostic Algorithm Last Viewed",

    "LI-RADS ® v2017 CEUS Core CEUS LI-RADS ® v2017 Reporting: Considerations Before Issuing a CEUS LI-RADS ® Report Use your judgment and common sense Tailor your recommendations to your patient. • Page 11 provides general guidance for imaging workup options, but note that optimal management may vary depending on the observation or patient. Is any observation path-proven to your knowledge? If an observation has been biopsied and there is no uncertainty about the path diagnosis (i.e., the path diagnosis is a malignant entity such as HCC or non-hepatocellular malignancy, or the path diagnosis is a non-hepatocellular benign entity such as hemangioma), then it is preferable to report the path diagnosis rather than the CEUS LI-RADS category. If an observation has been biopsied but there is either uncertainty about the path diagnosis or the path diagnosis is a potential HCC precursor (i.e., regenerative or dysplastic nodule), it is preferable to report the CEUS LI-RADS category and the path diagnosis together. Rationale: reporting both may alert the referrer to possible false-negative biopsy results and/or to the need for close follow-up to detect progression to frank malignancy. Is there tumor in vein? If yes, report the likely etiology. Most CEUS LR-TIV observations are HCC but some may be ICC, H- ChC, or other non-HCC malignancies. See page 15 for guidance on reporting CEUS LR-TIV. Is your patient a liver transplant candidate? Currently, OPTN does not recognize CEUS for HCC diagnosis. In the United States, liver transplant candidates with CEUS LR-5 observations need to undergo multiphasic CT or MRI to verify the LR-5 categorization and for staging. If CT or MRI does not verify LR-5 categorization for any CEUS LR-5 observation, consider discussion with and possible appeal to the regional review board. Avoid language that compels biopsy or other invasive procedure If consideration for liver biopsy is appropriate, the following phrases might be used: • “Options for diagnostic workup include ____ and possibly biopsy.” • “The distinction between HCC and ___ in this patient cannot be determined with imaging alone. If distinction would be helpful for patient management, biopsy may be considered.” • “Biopsy may be necessary to distinguish between HCC and ___.” • “…probably HCC. To establish a definite diagnosis, biopsy may be considered.” 12 Reporting Diagnostic Algorithm Last Viewed",

    "LI-RADS ® v2017 CEUS Core CEUS LI-RADS ® – Characterizing Washout At CEUS, all malignant nodules typically show washout, including intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and other fibrotic tumors that have delayed central enhancement on CT or MRI. Explanation: When using pure blood pool contrast agents (e.g., microbubbles), washout reflects the blood volume of lesion relative to liver. Since all malignant lesions have lower blood volume than liver, all appear to wash out. In fact, although the exact mechanism is not yet understood, ICCs and other non-HCC malignancies typically wash out earlier and more completely than HCCs. Implication: To maintain specificity for HCC, CEUS characterization of washout requires assessment of its “onset” and “degree”, not just its presence. Washout Onset a Early (< 60 s) Late (≥ 60 s) Washout Degree b Marked Typical of ICC and metastases Suggests malignancy in general, not specific for any particular type Mild Suggests malignancy in general, not specific for any particular type Typical of HCC and HCC precursor nodules a. Onset: time after injection (in seconds) at which WO is first detected relative to liver: • Early: onset detected < 60 s after contrast injection. • Late: onset detected ≥ 60 s after contrast injection. b. Degree: degree of WO, assessed by comparing nodule to liver enhancement in PVP and LP: • Marked: nodule virtually devoid of enhancement (“punched - out”) by 2 min after contrast injection. • Mild: nodule less enhanced than liver, but not devoid of enhancement (i.e., some enhancement persists). If this persistent enhancement disappears after 2 minutes, the degree of WO is still considered mild, even if the nodule eventually becomes “punched - out”. See FAQ page 24 . Effect on categorization: Nodules with late and mild washout may be categorized as CEUS LR-3, LR-4, or LR-5. Nodules with early or marked washout should be categorized LR-M.

    "LI-RADS ® v2017 CEUS Core Examples of CEUS LR-1 and criteria for LR-2 Entities Examples and criteria: • Cyst • Anechoic lesion with increased posterior acoustic through transmission showing no contrast enhancement in any phase. • Hemangioma • Variable echogenicity lesion with peripheral discontinuous globular enhancement in arterial phase followed by progressive centripetal contrast filling and iso- or hyperenhancement in portal venous and late phase. • The filling may be complete or partial depending on lesion size. • Hepatic fat deposition/sparing • Nonmasslike, nonspherical, hyper/hypoechoic area of parenchyma in a characteristic location for fat deposition/sparing and with isoenhancement in all phases. • Characteristic areas include around the gallbladder fossa and anterior to the right portal vein in segment 4. • If the hyper/hypoechoic area is not in a characteristic location for fat deposition/sparing, categorize as CEUS LR-2 (see below). • See CEUS LI-RADS manual (pending) for more information. Criteria: • Distinct isoenhancing solid nodule < 10 mm • If isoenhancing nodule is ≥ 10 mm, categorize as CEUS LR -3. See CEUS LI-RADS diagnostic algorithm ( page 5 ). • Nonmasslike isoenhancing observation of any size, not typical hepatic fat deposition/sparing. • If the observation represents focal deposition/sparing, categorize as CEUS LR-1 (see above). • CEUS LR- 3 nodules with interval size stability for ≥ 2 years Explanation: nodules meeting these criteria are probably regenerative or low-grade dysplastic nodules. Caution: The CEUS enhancement features for HCC, FNH, and HCA overlap. Therefore, in patients at risk for HCC in whom application of CEUS LI-RADS is appropriate, nodules with CEUS features suggestive of FNH or HCA should be categorized conservatively. In general, they should NOT be categorized CEUS LR-1 or CEUS LR-2. 18 LR-1 and LR-2 CEUS LR-1 CEUS LR-2 Diagnostic Algorithm Last Viewed",
    "LI-RADS ® v2017 CEUS Core Getting Started What is a CEUS LI-RADS observation? How does it differ from a CT/MRI observation? An observation is a distinctive area compared to background liver at imaging. In CT and MRI, it may be a lesion or pseudolesion such as an arterioportal shunt. Unlike in CT or MRI, vascular pseudolesions are rare in CEUS. Thus, almost all CEUS observations are true lesions. I am not sure if my patient has cirrhosis. Can I apply CEUS LI-RADS? You can apply CEUS LI-RADS and provide a conditional category. For example: “25 mm mass with APHE and washout. If the patient has cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B, this meets criteria for CEUS LR- 5 (definitely HCC).” If available, you can add elastography to the ultrasound exam to evaluate l iver stiffness (or shear wave speed). If the elastographic measurement exceeds a validated threshold for cirrhosis using your scanner, you may provide a provisional CEUS LI-RADS category, making sure to comment that this assumes a diagnosis of cirrhosis as suggested by “ultrasound elastography stiffness of [XX] kPa (or shear wave speed of [XX] m/s)”. I do not see a lesion on precontrast US, can I do CEUS? CEUS LI-RADS v2017 applies only to observations visible on precontrast US. Although CEUS LI- RADS does not yet address CEUS of nodules occult on precontrast US, expert CEUS practitioners may use anatomic landmarks to co-localize and assess CT- or MRI-detected observations. Can CEUS LI-RADS be used in transplant candidates? CEUS LI-RADS can be used in transplant candidates if indicated clinically. Since UNOS does not officially recognize CEUS, however, a patient with a CEUS LR-5 observation needs multiphasic CT/MRI for diagnosis verification and staging prior to receiving HCC exception points. I have seen other systems called CEUS LI-RADS. Which is the official version? ACR CEUS LI-RADS ® is the official CEUS system endorsed by the ACR.

Other schemes called \"CEUS LI- RADS” are not ACR endorsed, Steering Committee approved, or included in the ACR LI-RADS Manual. Why does LI-RADS not apply to patients without risk factors, to patients < 18 years old, or to patients with cirrhosis due to congenital hepatic fibrosis? See CT/MRI LI-RADS Core Why does LI-RADS not apply to patients with cirrhosis due to a vascular disorder such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, Budd-Chiari syndrome, chronic portal vein occlusion, cardiac congestion, or diffuse nodular regenerative hyperplasia? Why shouldn’t I assign a LI -RADS category for path-proven malignancies and for path-proven benign lesions of non- hepatocellular origin? Should I assign a LI-RADS category to path-proven benign lesions of hepatocellular origin (e.g., regenerative or dysplastic nodules)? 19 FAQs Diagnostic Algorithm Last Viewed",
    "LI-RADS ® v2017 CEUS Core Diagnosis How does CEUS LI-RADS differ from CT/MR LI-RADS? Key differences between CEUS and CT/MRI LI-RADS are summarized below: CEUS LI-RADS v2017 CT/MRI LI-RADS v2017 Operator expertise High expertise required High expertise not required Observation visibility Precontrast visibility required Precontrast visibility not required Number of observations One to few One to many Context Diagnosis Diagnosis, staging, Rx response Type of contrast agent Blood pool ECA or HBA Permitted contrast injections One to multiple (if needed) Usually one Size thresholds for APHE < 10 mm, ≥ 10 mm < 10 mm, 10- 19 mm, ≥ 20 mm APHE High temporal resolution Single or few time points Washout phenomenon Washout is true washout Washout may be apparent, not true Washout characterization Onset and degree are critical Onset and degree not critical “Capsule”: type of feature Not a CEUS feature Major feature Growth: type of feature Ancillary feature Major feature (if exceeds threshold) Number of ancillary features Few Many Why does intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) show early marked washout on CEUS but delayed central enhancement on CT/MRI? CEUS microbubbles are too large to pass through vascular endothelial fenestrations. Instead, they remain confined to the blood space or bool pool (hence, “blood space agents” or “blood pool agents”) and their postarterial phase distribution reflects regional blood volume. Since ICCs have low blood volume, they show early and marked postarterial phase washout after administration of these agents – earlier and more marked, in fact, than most HCCs. By comparison, the low-molecular- weight (LMW) agents used in CT and MRI pass through endothelial fenestrations easily, extravasate into the interstitium, and accumulate progressively in the centrally located fibrous stroma of these tumors. This produces the characteristic delayed central enhancement of ICCs at CT or MRI. Why do HCCs typically show washout on CEUS and on CT/MRI? Washout is a poorly understood phenomenon. See 0DQXDO SHQGLQJ . A partial explanation: since most HCCs have lower blood volume and lower extracellular volume than liver, they generally exhibit washout with blood-pool agents and with LMW extracellular space agents. Why is LR- M termed “probably or definitely malignant”? Since rare benign entities (e.g., inflammatory pseudotumor, sclerosed hemangioma, abscess) may show LR-M features (e.g., rim APHE) on all dynamic imaging modalities (CEUS, CT, MR ), “ probably or definitely malignant” is more appropriate than “definitely malignant.” Is there a size threshold for CEUS LR-M? No. Although CEUS is usually performed to assess nodules ≥ 10 mm detected on surveillance US, smaller nodules with CEUS LR-M features may be identified during CEUS and should be categorized LR-M. Why are arterioportal shunts (APS) not visible on CEUS? One plausible explanation is that the microscopic shunts are too small to be depicted by CEUS, whereas CT and MRI detect the extravasation of contrast material into the regional interstitium. Regardless of the mechanism, the insensitivity of CEUS to perfusion alterations is an advantage because these can cause diagnostic confusion. Why do the tie-breaking rules choose lower certainty?

What syringe size should I use for injection? For Definity: use a 1mL syringe. For Lumason/SonoVue: use the supplied 5mL syringe. How should I inject contrast? Contrast should be injected manually over 2-3 seconds, maintaining steady hand pressure to prevent excess bubble destruction during delivery. The contrast bolus should be followed immediately by a 5-10 mL normal saline flush delivered at approximately 2 mL/sec. How should I measure observation size? Step 1 Acquire images in the appropriate plane – i.e., along the observation’s longest axis. If CEUS is performed for follow up of a previously detected observation, replicate the prior imaging plane using anatomic landmarks (e.g., portal and hepatic veins, gallbladder, falciform ligament) for orientation. Step 2 Measure the observation’s outer -to-outer edge dimension along its longest axis, using precontrast B-mode images if possible. If the margins are not clear on precontrast B- mode images, choose the CEUS image on which the margins are most clearly defined, avoiding the peak of arterial phase enhancement if possible. To evaluate size change between exams, select images on each exam acquired in the same plane and temporal phase.

    "LI-RADS ® v2017 CEUS Core Management CEUS LI-RADS suggests alternative diagnostic imaging (i.e., CT or MRI) in ≤ 6 months if there is no observation on precontrast US. Can you explain the rationale? One indication for CEUS is to assess LR-3, LR-4, and LR-M observations detected on prior CT or MRI. If CEUS is requested for this purpose but there is no observation on precontrast US, then LI- RADS recommends multiphase CT or MRI, rather than attempting CEUS. As mentioned on page 2 , expert practitioners may attempt CEUS if there is no observation on precontrast US, but this is not currently recommended by CEUS LI-RADS. We anticipate that CEUS LI-RADS will be expanded to include assessment of precontrast occult nodules. If alternative imaging is pursued, interpreters should use their judgment in recommending the appropriate modality (CT or MRI), contrast agent (extracellular or hepatobiliary), and time interval. The suggested management differs for CT/MRI LR-3 and CEUS LR-3. Why the difference? As explained in the CT/MRI manual, the suggested management for CT/MRI LR-3 is alternative or repeat diagnostic imaging in 3-6 months. By comparison, the suggested management for CEUS LR- 3 is alternative or repeat diagnostic imaging in ≤ 6 months, with consideration for multidisciplinary discussion (MDD). See page 11. The reason for emphasizing MDD for CEUS LR-3 is that the probability of HCC is thought to be greater for CEUS LR-3 than for CT/MRI LR-3: • Two recent studies 1,2 showed that most LR-3 observations detected at CT or MRI are benign or indolent lesions that can be followed safely without requiring MDD in all cases. • Less is known about the natural history of CEUS LR-3 observations, but preliminary evidence suggests that such observations warrant closer scrutiny. By definition, all CEUS observations are distinctive nodules in a cirrhotic liver visible on precontrast B-mode images, and thus have high probability of being HCC, unless contrast enhancement features are diagnostic of a benign entity such as a hemangioma. A recent retrospective study 3 found that 60% (45/75) of CEUS LR-3 observations were HCC (see below). Therefore, MDD should be considered for all CEUS LR-3 observations with deliberation of reasonable diagnostic options, which may include alternative imaging in less than 3 months or biopsy. What is the probability of HCC for each CEUS category? In a retrospective study 3 , Terzi et al. retrospectively reviewed a total of 350 consecutive CEUS- detected nodules in cirrhotic patients. Using CT/MRI (if appropriate) and/or nodule biopsy with histopathology evaluation as the reference, these authors reported the following probabilities associated with each CEUS category: • CEUS LR-M: 6/15 (40%) HCC, 2/15 (13%) H-ChC, 7/15 (47%) ICC • CEUS LR-5: 149/152 (98%) HCC, 1/152 (1%) H-ChC • CEUS LR-4: 90/102 (88%) HCC • CEUS LR-3: 45/75 (60%) HCC References 1.

    "LI-RADS ® v2017 CEUS Core Reporting Why does CEUS LI-RADS require reporting of each observation individually while CT/MRI LI- RADS allows aggregate reporting in some circumstances? A primary goal of LI-RADS is to facilitate clear and simple communication between radiologists, other specialists, and patients. CT and MRI sometimes detect so many observations and with such a broad range of clinical relevance that reporting all observations individually may clutter the report with unnecessary detail and obscure the main message. To communicate simply and clearly, radiologists are given the discretion to report CT and MRI observations in aggregate. By comparison, CEUS is a focused exam that evaluates a limited number of specifically targeted observations. Since only a limited number of specifically targeted observations are evaluated, each observation should be reported individually. How do I categorize and report a treated lesion? If you encounter a treated lesion during CEUS, describe any suspicious areas of enhancement or washout in or along the treatment area, including their size(s), as well their change since prior. If appropriate, include your confidence level and suggestions for further management. For example, • “ 12 mm nodular area along the treatment margin with arterial phase hyperenhancement and washout, highly suggestive of viable tumor.” OR • “Thick rim of slowly progressive enhancement along the treatment margin without washout. This may represent benign posttreatment change or ischemic tumor. In my opinion, this is equivocal for viability. Consider MDD for individualized workup and management.” Since CEUS LI-RADS treatment response criteria are not yet available, do not assign a formal CEUS LI-RADS treatment response category and consider further evaluation with CT or MRI when a treated lesion is encountered. What should I report if an observation is biopsied and and has a path-proven diagnosis? This depends on the pathology diagnosis: • If malignant or if benign of non- hepatocellular origin (e.g., hemangioma): report observation’s pathology diagnosis, clinically relevant imaging features, and change since prior. • If benign of hepatocellular origin (e.g., regenerative or dysplastic nodule): report observation’s CEUS LI-RADS category and path diagnosis, imaging features, and change since prior. Also specify the date of pathology acquisition as the lesion may have changed over time, especially if the biopsy-imaging time interval is long. What should I do if the path diagnosis of a biopsied observation is discordant with the CEUS LI-RADS category? Indicate in your report there is discordance, providing the CEUS LI-RADS category and the path diagnosis. Specify the date of pathology acquisition as the lesion may have changed over time. Explain briefly why you believe this represents a discordance. Consider multidisciplinary discussion with consensus review of the histology, imaging, and other clinical data to adjudicate the discordance.

    "LI-RADS ® v2017 CEUS Core Imaging Features Is washout on CEUS true washout? Quantitative time-intensity curve measurements show that the appearance of washout on CEUS reflects true washout 1.2 . On CT/MRI, the appearance of washout may reflect increased enhancement of surrounding parenchyma, rather than true decline in tumor enhancement, hence “washout”. The lesion shows mild washout initially and then washes out completely to look black. Is it mild or marked? This depends on the time after contrast injection at which the washout becomes marked. If the washout becomes marked at or before 2 minutes, characterize as marked. If the washout becomes marked only after 2 minutes, characterize as mild. If unsure, characterize as marked (to prevent false CEUS LR-5 categorization for non-HCC malignancies with borderline marked washout). How much growth is “unequivocal growth”? There is no “threshold” for determining unequivocal growth on CEUS. This is up to the interpreter. As a general rule, more than 5 mm is unequivocal. Does washout apply only to observations with APHE? No. Washout applies to isoenhancing observations in addition to observations with APHE. For example, both of the following nodules should be characterized as having washout: • Arterial phase isoenhancement followed by late-phase hypoenhancement. • Arterial phase hypoenhancement followed by isoenhancement followed by hypoenhancement Washout does NOT apply to nodules that remain hypoenhancing in all phases. See Manual/time-intensity curves (pending). Is there peripheral washout on CEUS? No. A CT/MRI feature of intrahepatic mass-forming cholangiocarcinomas and other non-HCC malignancies, peripheral washout is characterized by a concentric tumoral architecture (i.e., an arterialized, cellular rim and a fibrotic, watery center). The extracellular and hepatobiliary agents used in CT and MRI drain rapidly from the arterialized, cellular rim, manifesting as peripheral washout appearance. As they drain from the tumor periphery, the agents gradually accumulate in the expanded interstitial spaces of the tumor center, causing progressive/delayed central enhancement, which accentuates the conspicuity of the peripheral washout. CEUS agents are purely intravascular contrast agents (i.e., they do enter the interstitial compartment). They drain rapidly from all tumor components with low blood volume, including the arterialized cellular rim and the fibrotic, watery center. Hence, they yield an early-onset, marked washout throughout the tumor, not a pattern of central retention and peripheral washout. Why is enhancing “capsule” not a CEUS major feature of HCC? As pure intravascular agents, CEUS microbubbles do not leak into the large interstitial spaces of the tumor “capsule” and the tumor “capsule” tends to be isoechoic to surrounding liver on late -phase CEUS images. By comparison, the low-molecular-weight agents used in CT and MRI leak readily into the “capsule” interstitium, causing the characteristic enhancing capsule appearance of many progressed HCCs in the postarterial phases.
