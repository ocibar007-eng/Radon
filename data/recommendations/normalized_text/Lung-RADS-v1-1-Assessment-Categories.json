Population Prevalence Incomplete 0 Prior chest CT examination(s) being located for comparison Additional lung cancer screening CT images and/or comparison to prior chest CT examinations is needed n/a 1% Part or all of lungs cannot be evaluated Negative No nodules and definitely benign nodules 1 No lung nodules Continue annual screening with LDCT in 12 months < 1% 90% Nodule(s) with specific calcifications: complete, central, popcorn, concentric rings and fat containing nodules Benign Appearance or Behavior Nodules with a very low likelihood of becoming a clinically active cancer due to size or lack of growth 2 Perifissural nodule(s) (See Footnote 11) < 10 mm (524 mm 3 ) Solid nodule(s): < 6 mm (< 113 mm 3 ) new < 4 mm (< 34 mm 3 ) Part solid nodule(s): < 6 mm total diameter (< 113 mm 3 ) on baseline screening Non solid nodule(s) (GGN): <30 mm (< 14137 mm 3 ) OR ≥ 30 mm (≥ 14137 mm 3 ) and unchanged or slowly growing Category 3 or 4 nodules unchanged for ≥ 3 months Probably Benign Probably benign finding(s) ‐ short term follow up suggested; includes nodules with a low likelihood of becoming a clinically active cancer 3 Solid nodule(s): ≥ 6 to < 8 mm (≥ 113 to < 268 mm 3 ) at baseline OR new 4 mm to < 6 mm ( 34 to < 113 mm 3 ) 6 month LDCT 1 ‐ 2% 5% Part solid nodule(s) ≥ 6 mm total diameter ( ≥ 113 mm 3 ) with solid component < 6 mm (< 113 mm 3 ) OR new < 6 mm total diameter (< 113 mm 3 ) Non solid nodule(s) (GGN) ≥ 3 0 mm (≥ 14137 mm 3 ) on baseline CT or new Suspicious Findings for which additional diagnostic testing is recommended 4A Solid nodule(s): ≥ 8 to < 15 mm ( ≥ 268 to < 1767 mm 3 ) at baseline OR growing < 8 mm (< 268 mm 3 ) OR new 6 to < 8 mm ( 113 to < 268 mm 3 ) 3 month LDCT; PET/CT may be used when there is a ≥ 8 mm (≥ 268 mm 3 ) solid component 5 ‐ 15% 2% Part solid nodule(s ) : ≥ 6 mm (≥ 113 mm 3 ) with solid component ≥ 6 mm to < 8 mm (≥ 113 to < 268 mm 3 ) OR with a new or growing < 4 mm (< 34 mm 3 ) solid component Endobronchial nodule Very Suspicious Findings for which additional diagnostic testing and/or tissue sampling is recommended 4B Solid nodule(s) ≥ 15 mm (≥ 1767 mm 3 ) OR new or growing, and ≥ 8 mm (≥ 268 mm 3 ) Chest CT with or without contrast, PET/CT and/or tissue sampling depending on the *probability of malignancy and comorbidities. PET/CT may be used when there is a ≥ 8 mm (≥ 268 mm 3 ) solid component. For new large nodules that develop on an annual repeat sc reening CT, a 1 month LDCT may be recommended to address potentially infectious or inflammatory conditions > 15% 2% Part solid nodule(s) with: a solid component ≥ 8 mm (≥ 268 mm 3 ) OR a new or growing ≥ 4 mm ( ≥ 34 mm 3 ) solid component 4X Category 3 or 4 nodules with additional features or imaging findings that increases the suspicion of malignancy Other Clinically Significant or Potentially Clinically Significant Findings (non lung cancer) S Modifier ‐ may add on to category 0 ‐ 4 coding As appropriate to the specific finding n/a 10% IMPORTANT NOTES FOR USE: 1) Negative screen: does not mean that an individual does not have lung cancer 2) Size: To calculate nodule mean diameter, measure both the long and short axis to one decimal point, and report mean nodule diameter to one decimal point 3) Size Thresholds: apply to nodules at first detection, and that grow and reach a higher size category 4) Growth: an increase in size of > 1.5 mm ( > 2 mm 3 ) 5) Exam Category: each exam should be coded 0 ‐ 4 based on the nodule(s) with the highest degree of suspicion 6) Exam Modifiers: S modifier may be added to the 0 ‐ 4 category 7) Lung Cancer Diagnosis: Once a patient is diagnosed with lung cancer, further management (including additional imaging such as PET/CT) may be perf ormed for purposes of lung cancer staging; this is no longer screening 8) Practice audit definitions: a negative screen is defined as categories 1 and 2; a positive screen is defined as categories 3 and 4 9) Category 4B Management: this is predicated on the prob ability of malignancy based on patient evaluation, patient preference and risk of malignancy; radiologists are encouraged to use the McWilliams et al assessment tool when making recommendations 10) Category 4X: nodules with additional imaging findings that inc rease the suspicion of lung cancer, such as spiculation, GGN that doubles in size in 1 year, enlarged lymph nodes etc 11) Solid nodules with smooth margins, an oval, lentiform or triangular shape, and maximum diameter less than 10 mm or 524 mm 3 (perifissural nodules) should be classified as category 2 12) Category 3 and 4A nodules that are unchanged on interval CT should be coded as category 2, and individuals returned to screen ing in 12 months 13) LDCT: low dose chest CT * Additional resources available at - https://www.acr.org/Clinical - Resources/Reporting - and - Data - Systems/Lung - Rads *Link to Lung - RADS calculator - https://brocku.ca/lung - cancer - screening - and - risk - prediction/risk - calculators/"
