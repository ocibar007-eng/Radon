    "Release Date: February 2024 Glossary ▪ Adnexal: Involving one or both ovaries or the fallopian tubes ▪ Lesion: Non - physiologic finding ( i.e., n ot a normal ovary, follicle, or corpus luteum) ▪ Cystic lesion: Fluid - filled unilocular or multilocular lesion , with or without solid tissue ▪ Types of fluid: Simple , lipid, endometriotic, hemorrhagic and proteinaceous (e.g., mucinous ) ▪ Solid tissue: Enhances on post - contrast images and conforms to one of the following morphologies: papillary projection ( s ) , mural nodule ( s ) , irregular septation ( s ) / walls or larger solid portion ▪ Not solid tissue: Enhancing smooth septation ( s ) , non - enhancing debris, fat, or Rokitansky nodule ▪ Enhancement: Increase in signal intensity after contrast injection. When there is high signal on the pre - contrast T1 weighted image, subtracted images are needed to evaluate for enhancement ▪ T ime intensity curves (TIC) : Low risk (no shoulder), intermediate risk (shoulder ; slope of enhancement is < myometrium), high risk (shoulder ; slope of enhancement > myometrium) O - RADS ™ MRI Assessment Categories O - RADS 1 Peritoneal disease and adnexal l esion O - RADS 4 Multi - locular Rokitansky nodule or n o enhancing solid tissue Uni - locular O - RADS 5 Normal o vary Adnexal l esi on with lipid content Large volume enhancing solid tissue Adnexal l esion without lipid content Enhancing solid tissue No enhancing solid tissue Intermediate risk TIC o r < myometrium No wall enhancement Simple or endometriotic fluid Proteinaceous , mucinous or hemorrhagic O - RADS 2 Homogenously dark T2 and dark DWI Intermediate or high signal on T 2 and/or DWI NOTE : A p araovarian cyst , with any fluid type , thin , smooth wall, ± wall enhancement, and no solid tissue is scored as O - RADS MRI 2 Dilated fallopian tube No enhancing tissue , thin walls , and s imple fluid No enhancing tissue and either simple fluid with thick smooth walls or non - simple flui d with thin walls O - RADS 3 O - RADS 2 Low risk TIC High risk TIC or > m yometrium O - RADS 2 O - RADS 2 O - RADS 2 O - RADS 3 O - RADS 3 O - RADS 4 O - RADS 5 O - RADS 3 No lesion Phy siolog ic cyst - Follicl e - Corpus Luteum Wall enhancement © 2023 American College of Radiology ® | All rights reserved"
