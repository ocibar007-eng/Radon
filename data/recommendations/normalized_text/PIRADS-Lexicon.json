If the highest PIRADS Assessment Category is assigned to two or more lesions, the index lesion should be one that shows EPE or is largest. Also known as dominant lesion A localized pathological or traumatic structural change, damage, deformity, or discontinuity of tissue, organ, or body part A three - dimensional space occupying structure resulting from an accumulation of neoplastic cells, inflammatory cells, or cystic changes A small lump, swelling or collection of tissue Not localized to a single focus Widely spread; not localized or confined; distributed over multiple areas, may or may not extend in contiguity, does not conform to anatomical boundaries Multiple foci distinct from neighboring tissues Conforming to prostate sector, sextant, zone, or lobe; abnormal signal other than a mass involving a large volume of prostatic tissue ABNORMALITY Focal abnormality Focus Index Lesion Lesion Mass Nodule Non-focal abnormality Diffuse Multifocal Regional SHAPE Round The shape of a circle or sphere Oval The shape of either an oval or an ellipse Lenticular Having the shape of a double-convex lens, crescentic Lobulated Composed of lobules with undulating contour Water-drop-shaped Tear-shaped Having the shape of a tear or drop of water; it differs from an oval because one end is clearly larger than the other Wedge-shaped Having the shape of a wedge, pie, or V-shaped Linear In a line or band-like shape Irregular Lacking symmetry or evenness",

It is separated from the peripheral zone by a “surgical capsule” (or “pseudocapsule”) delineated as a low signal line on T2 weighted MRI",
    "PI - RADS ® v2.1 American College of Radiology ® 2019 5 PI-RADSv2.1 Central zone Tissue surrounding the ejaculatory ducts posterior and superior, from the base of the prostate to the verumontanum; it has the shape of an inverted cone with its base oriented towards the base of the gland; contains more stroma than glandular tissue Anterior fibromuscular stroma Located anteriorly and contains smooth muscle, which mixes with periurethral muscle fibers at the bladder neck; co nta i n s no glandular tissue Prostate: Sectors Anatomical regions defined for the purpose of prostate targeting during interventions, may include multiple constitutional and regional parts of the prostate. Thirty - eight sectors for standardized MRI prostate localization reporting are identified, with addition of seminal v esicles and membranous urethra. Each traditional prostate sextant is sub - divided into six sectors, to include: the anterior fibromuscular stroma, the transition zone anterior and posterior sectors, the peripheral zone anterior, lateral, and medial sectors. The anterior and posterior sectors are defined by a line bisecting the prostate into the anterior and posterior halves . See Sector Map Diagram Prostate “ capsule ” Histologically, there is no distinct capsule that surrounds the prostate, however historically the “ capsule ” has been defined as an outer band of the prostatic fibromuscular stroma blending with endopelvic fascia that may be visible on imaging as a distinct thin layer of tissue surrounding or partially surrounding the peripheral zone Prostate pseudocapsule Imaging appearance of a thin “capsule” around transition zone when no true capsule is present at histological evaluation. The junction of the transition and peripheral zones marked by a visible hypointense linear boundary, which is often referred to as the prostate “pseudocapsule” capsule” or “surgical Seminal vesicle One of the two paired glands in the male genitourinary system, posterior to the bladder and superior to the prostate gland, that produces fructose - rich seminal fluid which is a component of semen. These glands join the ipsilateral ductus (vas) deferens to form the ejaculatory duct at the base of the prostate Neurovascular bundle of prostate (NVB) Nerve fibers from the lumbar sympathetic chain extend inferiorly to the pelvis along the iliac arteries and intermix with parasympathetic nerve fibers branching off S2 to S4. The mixed nerve bundles run posterior to the bladder, seminal vesicles, and prostate as the “pelvic plexus”. The cavernous nerve arises from the pelvic p lexus and runs along the posterolateral aspect of the prostate on each side. Arterial and venous vessels accompany the cavernous nerve, and together these structures form the neurovascular bundles which are best visualized on MR imaging at 5 and 7 o’clock position. At the apex and the base of the prostate, the bundles send penetrating branches through the “ capsule ”, providing a potential route for extraprostatic tumor spread.",
    "PI - RADS ® v2.1 American College of Radiology ® 2019 6 PI-RADSv2.1 Right neurovascular bundle Located at 7 o’clock postero - lateral position. Left neurovascular bundle Located at 5 o’c lock postero - lateral position. Vas deferens The excretory duct of the testes that carries spermatozoa; it rises from the scrotum and joins the seminal vesicles to form the ejaculatory duct, which opens into the mid pro static urethra at the level of the verumontanum. Verumontanum The verumontanum (urethral crest formed by an elevation of the mucous membrane and its subjacent tissue) is an elongated ridge on the posterior wall of the mid prostatic urethra at the site of ejaculatory ducts opening into the prostatic urethra Neck of urinary bladder The inferior portion of the urinary bladder which is formed as the walls of the bladder converge and become contiguous with the proximal urethra Urethra: Prostatic The proximal prostatic urethra extends from the bladder neck at the base of the prostate to verumontanum in the mid prostate. The distal prostatic urethra extends from the verumontanum to the membranous urethra and contains striated muscle of the urethral sphincter Urethra: Membranous The membranous segment of the urethra is located between the apex of the prostate and the bulb of the corpus spongiosum, extending through the urogenital diaphragm External urethral sphincter Surrounds the whole length of the membranous portion of the urethra and is enclosed in the fascia of the urogenital diaphragm Periprostatic compartment Space surrounding the prostate Rectoprostatic compartment / Rectoprostatic angle Space between the prostate and the rectum Extraprostatic Pertaining to an area outside the prostate Prostate – seminal vesicle angle The plane or space between the prostate base and the seminal vesicle, normally filled with fatty tissue and neurovascular bundle of prostate",
