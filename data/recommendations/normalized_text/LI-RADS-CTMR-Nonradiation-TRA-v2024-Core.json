Apply nonradiation TRA decision tree to assess for masslike enhancement (any degree, any phase) in treated lesion, along treated lesion margin, or along surgical margin Step 2 (Optional). Apply ancillary features (AFs) favoring viability to upgrade from LR - TR Equivocal to LR - TR Viable: Step 3. Apply tiebreaking rules if needed: if unsure between two TRA categories, choose category reflecting lower certainty (i.e., LR - TR Equivocal ) Step 4. Final check. After steps 1, 2 and 3 – Consider if the assigned TRA category is reasonable and appropriate. • Key concept for nonradiation TRA : tumor response should be immediate . • New or untreated observations outside treatment zone: apply CT/MRI Dx Algorithm. • Lesions treated by radiation - based LRT: apply radiation TRA algorithm . • In combination with systemic therapy: apply TRA algorithms with caution . • No masslike enhancement – examples include: complete lesion disappearance, no lesional enhancement, smooth perilesional enhancement, or parenchymal perfusional changes without masslike enhancement N o masslike enhancement present* LR - TR Nonviable U ncertainty about masslike enhancement (presence or morphology) LR - TR Equivocal LR - TR Nonevaluable Presence of masslike enhancement cannot be assessed due to image degradation or omission LR - TR Viable Masslike enhancement (any degree, any phase ) • What: diffusion restriction or mild - moderate T2 hyperintensity • Where: in area of uncertain masslike enhancement LR - TR Equivocal LR - TR Viable LR - TR Nonviable LR - TR Equivocal LR - TR Viable",

Two Cores • The CT/MRI TRA system now has two separate Cores: • Nonradiation TRA Core for assessing TRA after nonradiation - based LRT or surgical resection • Radiation TRA Core for assessing TRA after radiation - based LRT • Both TRA were previously included in a single TRA algorithm. New algorithm for TRA after radiation - based locoregional therapies (LRTs) • Incorporating latest advances in knowledge, the updated CT/MRI TRA system includes a new algorithm for TRA after internal and external beam radiation - based LRTs, such as transarterial radioembolization (TARE) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), respectively. • It previously included a single algorithm for TRA after radiation - and nonradiation - based LRTs. Single feature for LR - TR Viable • Incorporating latest advances in knowledge, the updated CT/MRI TRA system now has a single feature of viability. • It previously had three major features for viability. v2017 Three features of viability: • Nodular, masslike, or thick irregular tissue with arterial phase hyperenhancement, w ashout or enhancement similar to pretreatment v2024 Single feature for nonradiation TRA: • Masslike enhancement ( any degree, any phase) Addition of ancillary features • Incorporating latest advances in knowledge, the updated CT/MRI TRA system has added ancillary features favoring viability to enable optional (at user’s discretion) upgrade from LR - TR Equivocal to LR - TR Viable or from LR - TR Nonprogressing to LR - TR Viable. • For nonradiation TRA: The following ancillary features can be used optionally to upgrade from LR - TR Equivocal to LR - TR Viable: • What: diffusion restriction (any degree) or mild - moderate T2 hyperintensity • Where: in area of uncertain enhancement 1",

    "LI - RADS ® CT/MRI Nonradiation TRA v2024 Core ⓒ 2024 American College of Radiology® | All rights reserved Nonradiation TRA Algorithm Nonradiation TRA Algorithm Abbreviations Table of Contents Table of Contents LI - RADS ® Treatment Response Features Viability Presence of live tumor cells within or along margin of treated lesion. Radiologic viability is not synonymous with pathologic viability as i maging is not sensitive to microscopic or small foci of residual tumor. Major feature of viability Imaging feature that by itself can be used to assign LR - TR Viable category. In the LI - RADS TRA v2024 system, there is ONE major feature of viability: masslike enhancement. Masslike enhancement Enhancing area (any degree, any phase) that occupies space. Examples of masslike enhancement: • nodular enhancement • irregular peripheral enhancement • thick rim of enhancement Comments: Masslike enhancement is the major feature of viability after LRT or surgical resection. It is interpreted as follows: • After nonradiation - based LRT or surgical resection: • If there is masslike enhancement in a treated lesion, along treated lesion margin, or along surgical margin after resection, it is interpreted as viable tumor • if there is uncertainty about masslike enhancement (presence, morphology), it is interpreted as equivocal for viable tumor • After radiation - based LRT: • if there is masslike enhancement, which is new or increased over time after treatment, in a treated lesion or along treated lesion margin, it is interpreted as viable tumor • if there is masslike enhancement, which is stable or decreased over time after treatment, in a treated lesion or along treated lesion margin, it is interpreted as nonprogressing tumor Definitions 6",

In the LI - RADS TRA v2024 system, there are TWO ancillary features favoring viability: diffusion restriction (any degree) and mild - moderate T2 hyperintensity. Comments: Both features favoring viability apply only to MRI. There are no ancillary features favoring viability applicable to CT. There are no ancillary features favoring nonviability. Definitions 7 Diffusion restriction (any degree) Intensity higher than liver on diffusion - weighted images not caused only by T2 shine - through. Mild - moderate T2 hyperintensity Intensity on T2WI higher than liver, similar to or lower than non - iron - overloaded spleen, and lower than simple fluid. Comments: Diffusion restriction (any degree) and mild - moderate T2 hyperintensity are ancillary features favoring viability after LRT or surgical resection. They can be used optionally ( at user’s discretion) to upgrade from LR - TR Equivocal to LR - TR Viable or from LR - TR Nonprogressing to LR - TR Viable as follows: • After nonradiation - based LRT or surgical resection: • if one or both ancillary features is present in an area of uncertain masslike enhancement, the category can be upgraded from LR - TR Equivocal to LR - TR Viable. • After radiation - based LRT: • if one or both ancillary features is new or increased over time after treatment in an area of stable or decreased masslike enhancement, the category can be upgraded from LR - TR Nonprogressing to LR - TR Viable.",

FOUR such examples are listed and defined below. Complete lesion disappearance Nonvisualization of treated lesion on posttreatment multiphase CT or MRI, despite inclusion of required images, adequate image quality, and proper timing of late arterial phase No lesional enhancement Absence of enhancement with in treated lesion or along its margin Smooth perilesional enhancement Smooth rim of enhancement along margin of treated lesion . Parenchymal perfusional changes Treatment - related nonmasslike enhancement of hepatic parenchyma around treated lesion, ablation needle track, or surgical margin Examples: • linear enhancement around hypoenhancing needle track after thermal or chemical ablation • geographic enhancement peripheral to treated lesion after intra - arterial embolization • geographic enhancement in surrounding radiation - treated lesion • geographic enhancement along surgical margin after resection Comments: Complete lesion disappearance, no lesional enhancement, smooth perilesional enhancement, and parenchymal perfusion changes are examples of absence of masslike enhancement. These features are commonly encountered after locoregional therapy or surgical resection, alone or in combination, and should not be interpreted as viable tumor. Definitions 8",

Continue posttreatment monitoring with alternative modality in ≤ 3 months. • Suggested option if imaging with a different modality or contrast agent would confer diagnostic advantage. Response Criteria LR - TR Nonevaluable Conceptual definition: Treatment response cannot be meaningfully evaluated due to inappropriate imaging technique or inadequate imaging quality. Criterion: Presence of masslike enhancement cannot be assessed due to image degradation or omission. • Do NOT assign LR - TR Nonevaluable evaluable if the recommended contrast phases were acquired and are of acceptable quality, including proper late arterial phase timing. • Do NOT assign LR - TR Nonevaluable for treated lesions in which response categorization is challenged only by unusual imaging features. Potential causes: Motion or other artifacts, absence of one or more required contrast - enhanced phases, failure of contrast injection, gross arterial phase mistiming (too early or too late). 9 ?",
