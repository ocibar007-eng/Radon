    "Lung ‐ RADS ™ Version 1.0 Assessment Categories Release date: April 28, 2014 Category Category Descriptor Category Findings Management Probability of Malignancy Estimated Population Prevalence prior chest CT examination(s) being located for comparison part or all of lungs cannot be evaluated no lung nodules nodule(s) with specific calcifications: complete, central, popcorn, concentric rings and fat containing nodules solid nodule(s): < 6 mm new < 4 mm part solid nodule(s): < 6 mm total diameter on baseline screening non solid nodule(s) (GGN): < 20 mm OR ≥ 20 mm and unchanged or slowly growing category 3 or 4 nodules unchanged for ≥ 3 months solid nodule(s): ≥ 6 to < 8 mm at baseline OR new 4 mm to < 6 mm part solid nodule(s) ≥ 6 mm total diameter with solid component < 6 mm OR new < 6 mm total diameter non solid nodule(s) (GGN) ≥ 20 mm on baseline CT or new solid nodule(s): ≥ 8 to < 15 mm at baseline OR growing < 8 mm OR new 6 to < 8 mm part solid nodule(s: ≥ 6 mm with solid component ≥ 6 mm to < 8 mm OR with a new or growing < 4 mm solid component endobronchial nodule solid nodule(s) ≥ 15 mm OR new or growing, and ≥ 8 mm part solid nodule(s) with: a solid component ≥ 8 mm OR a new or growing ≥ 4 mm solid component 4X Category 3 or 4 nodules with additional features or imaging findings that increases the suspicion of malignancy Other Clinically Significant or Potentially Clinically Significant Findings (non lung cancer) S modifier ‐ may add on to category 0 ‐ 4 coding As appropriate to the specific finding n/a 10% Prior Lung Cancer Modifier for patients with a prior diagnosis of lung cancer who return to screening C modifier ‐ may add on to category 0 ‐ 4 coding ‐ ‐ ‐ IMPORTANT NOTES FOR USE: 1) Negative screen: does not mean that an individual does not have lung cancer 2) Size: nodules should be measured on lung windows and reported as the average diameter rounded to the nearest whole number; for round nodules only a single diameter measurement is necessary 3) Size Thresholds: apply to nodules at first detection, and that grow and reach a higher size category 4) Growth: an increase in size of > 1.5 mm 5) Exam Category: each exam should be coded 0 ‐ 4 based on the nodule(s) with the highest degree of suspicion 6) Exam Modifiers: S and C modifiers may be added to the 0 ‐ 4 category 8) Practice audit definitions: a negative screen is defined as categories 1 and 2; a positive screen is defined as categories 3 and 4 10) Category 4X: nodules with additional imaging findings that increase the suspicion of lung cancer, such as spiculation, GGN that doubles in size in 1 year, enlarged lymph nodes etc 11) Nodules with features of an intrapulmonary lymph node should be managed by mean diameter and the 0 ‐ 4 numerical category classification 12) Category 3 and 4A nodules that are unchanged on interval CT should be coded as category 2, and individuals returned to screening in 12 months 13) LDCT: low dose chest CT *Link to McWilliams Lung Cancer Risk Calculator Upon request from the authors at: http://www.brocku.ca/lung ‐ cancer ‐ risk ‐ calculator At UptoDate http://www.uptodate.com/contents/calculator ‐ solitary ‐ pulmonary ‐ nodule ‐ malignancy ‐ risk ‐ brock ‐ university ‐ cancer ‐ prediction ‐ equation 9) Category 4B Management: this is predicated on the probability of malignancy based on patient evaluation, patient preference and risk of malignancy; radiologists are encouraged to use the McWilliams et al assessment tool when making recommendations 7) Lung Cancer Diagnosis: Once a patient is diagnosed with lung cancer, further management (including additional imaging such as PET/CT) may be performed for purposes of lung cancer staging; this is no longer screening 0 Findings for which additional diagnostic testing and/or tissue sampling is recommended Suspicious 2% 1% Incomplete ‐ n/a Additional lung cancer screening CT images and/or comparison to prior chest CT examinations is needed 4A 5 ‐ 15% 3 Probably Benign Probably benign finding(s) ‐ short term follow up suggested; includes nodules with a low likelihood of becoming a clinically active cancer 6 month LDCT Benign Appearance or Behavior > 15% 2% No nodules and definitely benign nodules 1 Negative 2 3 month LDCT; PET/CT may be used when there is a ≥ 8 mm solid component chest CT with or without contrast, PET/CT and/or tissue sampling depending on the *probability of malignancy and comorbidities. PET/CT may be used when there is a ≥ 8 mm solid component. 4B 1 ‐ 2% 5% < 1% Continue annual screening with LDCT in 12 months 90% Nodules with a very low likelihood of becoming a clinically active cancer due to size or lack of growth"
